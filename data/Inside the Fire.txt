Devon
Won't go to heaven
She's just another lost soul,
About to be mine again
Leave her
we will receive her

It is beyond your control

will you ever meet again



Devon

Around 11

Who was rendered unwhole

As a little child,

she was taken

and then forsaken

you will remember it all

Let it blow your mind again



Devon lies beyond this portal

take the word of one immortal

Give your soul to me

For eternity

release your life

to begin another time with her

End your grief with me

there's another way

release your life

take your place inside the fire with love



Sever

Now and forever

you're just another lost soul about to be mine again

see her, you'll never free her

you must surrender it all

Would you like to meet again



Fire

All you desire

As she begins to turn cold and run out of time

you will shiver

till you deliver

you will remember it all

Let it blow your mind again



Devon lies beyond this portal

take the word of one immortal

Give your soul to me

For eternity

release your life

to begin another time with her

End your grief with me

there's another way

release your life

take your place inside the fire with love



Give your soul to me

For eternity

release your life

to begin another time with her

End your grief with me

there's another way

release your life

take your place inside the fire with love



Devon

Around 11

Who was rendered unwhole

As a little child

she was taken,

and then forsaken

you will remember it all

Let it blow your mind again
