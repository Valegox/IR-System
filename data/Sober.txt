There's a shadow just behind me,
shrouding every step I take,
making every promise empty,
pointing every finger at me.
Waiting like a stalking butler
who upon the finger rests.

Murder now the path called "must we"

just before the son has come.

Jesus, won't you fucking whistle

something but the past and done?

Jesus, won't you fucking whistle

something but the past and done?



Why can't we not be sober?

I just want to start this over.

Why can't we drink forever.

I just want to start things over.



I am just a worthless liar.

I am just an imbecile.

I will only complicate you.

Trust in me and fall as well.

I will find a center in you.

I will chew it up and leave,

I will work to elevate you

just enough to bring you down.



Mother Mary won't you whisper

something but what's past and done.

Mother Mary won't you whisper

something but what's past and done.



Why can't we not be sober?

I just want to start this over.

Why can't we sleep forever?

I just want to start this over.



I am just a worthless liar.

I am just an imbecile.

I will only complicate you.

Trust in me and fall as well.

I will find a center in you.

I will chew it up and leave,

Trust me, trust me, trust me, trust me, trust me!



Why can't we not be sober?

I just want to start this over.

Why can't we sleep forever?

I just want to start this over.



I want, what I want

I want, what I want

I want, what I want

I want, what I want
