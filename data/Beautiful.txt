Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?

Are you reaching out for me?

I'm reaching out for you...



I'm just so fuckin depressed, 

I just can't seem to get out this slump

If I could just get over this hump, 

but I need something to pull me out this dump

I took my bruises, took my lumps, 

fell down and I got right back up

But I need that spark to get psyched back up, 

in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when I ended up 

in this position I'm in

I'm startin to feel distant again, 

so I decided just to pick this pen



Up and try to make an attempt to vent 

but I just can't admit or come to grips

With the fact that I may be done with rap, 

I need a new outlet

And I know some shit so hard to swallow, 

but I just can't sit back and wallow

In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, 

I'll be one tough act to follow

One tough act to follow

I'll be one tough act to follow

Here today, gone tomorrow, 

but you'd have to walk a thousand miles...



In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me, 

I'll be you, let's trade shoes

Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, 

you feel mine, go inside each others minds

Just to see what we'd find, 

look at shit through each others eyes



But don't let them say you ain't beautiful

They can all get FUCKED, just stay true to you



So don't let them say you ain't beautiful

They can all get FUCKED, just stay true to you



I think I'm startin to lose my sense of humor, 

everythings so tense and gloom, I

Almost feel like I got to check the temperture 

of the room just as soon as

I walk in, it's like all eyes on me, 

so I try to avoid any eye contact

Cause if I do that, then it opens the door 

for coversation, like I want that

I'm not looking for extra attention, 

I just want to be just like you



Blend in with the rest of the room, 

maybe just point me to the closest restroom

I don't need no fuckin man servant, 

tryna follow me around and wipe my ass

And laugh at every single joke 

I crack and half of them ain't even funny like

"Ahh, Marshall you're so funny man 

you should be a comedian, god damn"

Unfortunately I am, I just hide 

behind the tears of a clown

So why don't you all sit down, 

listen to the tale I'm about to tell

Hell, we ain't gotta trade our shoes, 

and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles



In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me, 

I'll be you, let's trade shoes

Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, 

you feel mine, go inside each others minds

Just to see what we'd find, 

look at shit through each others eyes



Nobody asked for life to deal us 

what these bullshit hands were dealt

We gotta take these cards ourselves, 

and flip them, don't expect no help

Now I could of either just sat on my ass 

and pissed and moaned

Or take this situation in which I'm placed, 

and get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid to wait by the door 

and pack his bags

Or sat on the porch and hoped and pray 

for a dad to show up who never did

I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, 

every school I went

I dreamed of being that cool kid, 

even if it meant actin stupid



And Aunt Edna was told me, 

keep makin that face it'll get stuck like that

Meanwhile I'm just standin there holdin my tongue 

tryna talk like "thissss"

Till I stuck my tongue on that 

frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old

I learned my lesson then,

cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story, 

not just based on my description

Cause where you see it, from where you're sittin, 

it's probably 110 percent different

I guess we would have to walk a mile 

in each others shoes at least

What size you wear? I wear 10's, 

let's see if you could fit your feet...



In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me, 

I'll be you, let's trade shoes

Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, 

you feel mine, go inside each others minds

Just to see what we'd find, 

look at shit through each others eyes



Lately I've been hard to reach

Are you calling me?

Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. 

Dad will be home soon. 

And to the rest of the world, 

God gave you them shoes, to fit you, 

so put them on and wear em. Be yourself man. 

Be proud of who you are. Even if it sounds corny, 

don't ever let anyone tell you, you ain't beautiful.
