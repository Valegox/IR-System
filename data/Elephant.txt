Bet he feels like an elephant
Shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it
You know that youre dreaming about being loved by him
Too bad your chances are slim
And it's not like Mr. Shock

To get shy when I ask who is on top?

There must be something deep down in the middle of down there

He's not too easily scared



He's got friends but you get the feeling

Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared

Oh, look there he is now coming down the stairs

(Here he comes)



He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac (yeah)

Â‘Cause he doesn't like it looking like he looks back

He talks like his opinion is a simple fact

Somebody grabbed his collar

He cried the whole way home

He won't remember a thing 'til it started again

That's how it is 'til the end (yeah)
