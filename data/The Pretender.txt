Keep you in the dark you know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark and so it all began
Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marching in again
They need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are ever ready

Are you ready

I'm finished making sense

Done bleeding ignorance at home defense



Spinning and spinning deeper

The wheel is spinning me

It's never ending

Never ending

Same old story



What if I say I'm not like the others

What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays

You're the pretender

What if I say I will never surrender



What if I say I'm not like the others

What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays

You're the pretender

What if I say I will never surrender



In time or so I'm told

I'm just another soul for sale

Oh well

The page is out of print

We are not permanent

Temporary

Temporary

Same old story



What if I say I'm not like the others

What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays

You're the pretender

What if I say I will never surrender



What if I say I'm not like the others

What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays

You're the pretender

What if I say I will never surrender



I'm the voice inside your head

You refuse to hear

I'm the face that you have to face

Mirroring your stare

I'm what's left

I'm what's right

I'm the enemy

I'm the hand that took you down

Bring you to your knees



So who are you

Yeah who are you

Yeah who are you

Yeah who are you



Keep you in the dark you know they all pretend



What if I say I'm not like the others

What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays

You're the pretender

What if I say I will never surrender



What if I say I'm not like the others

What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays

You're the pretender

What if I say I will never surrender



What if I say I'm not like the others

What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays

You're the pretender

What if I say I will never surrender



What if I say I'm not like the others

What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays

You're the pretender

What if I say I will never surrender



So who are you

Yeah who are you

Yeah who are you
