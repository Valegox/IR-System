Ooh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the door
You and I get so damn dysfunctional we stop keeping score

You and I get sick, yeah I know that we can't do this no more



But baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you

And I stop using my head, using my head, let it all go

Now you're stuck on my body, on my body, like a tatoo

And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid, crawling back to you



So I cross my heart and I hope to die

That I'll only stay with you one more night

And I know I said it a milion times

But I'll only stay with you one more night



Try to tell you no, but my body keeps on telling you yes

Try to tell you stop, but your lipstick's got me so out of breath

I'll be waking up in the morning, probably hating myself

And I'll be waking up feeling satisfied but guilty as hell



But baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you

And I stop using my head, using my head, let it all go

Got you're stuck on my body, on my body, like a tatoo

And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid, crawling back to you



So I cross my heart and I hope to die

That I'll only stay with you one more night

And I know I said it a milion times

But I'll only stay with you one more night



(ooh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)

Yeah baby give me one more night

(ooh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)

Yeah baby give me one more night

(ooh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)

Yeah baby give me one more night



Baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you

And I stop using my head, using my head, let it all go 

Got you stuck on my body, on my body, like a tatoo



So I cross my heart and I hope to die

That I'll only stay with you one more night

And I know I said it a milion times

But I'll only stay with you one more night



So I cross my heart and I hope to die

That I'll only stay with you one more night

And I know I said it a milion times

But I'll only stay with you one more night



Now baby give me one more night
