where do we go from here?
the words are coming out all wierd
where are you now when i need you?
alone on an aeroplane
falling asleep against the window pane
my blood will THICKEN.



i need to wash myself again to hide all the dirt and pain

i'd be scared that there's nothing underneath

and who are my real friends?

have they all got the bends?

am i really sinking this low?



my baby's got the bends

we don't have any real friends

i'm just lying in a bar with my drip feed on

talking to my girlfriend waiting for something to happen

and i wish it was the sixties

i wish i could be happy

i wish

i wish

i wish that something would happen..



where do we go from here?

the words are coming out all wierd

where are you now when i need you?

they brought in the CIA

the tanks and the whole marines to blow me away

to blow me sky high.



my baby's got the bends

we don't have any real friends

i'm just lying in a bar with my drip feed on

talking to my girlfriend waiting for something to happen

and i wish it was the sixties

i wish i could be happy

i wish

i wish

i wish that something would happen



i want to live and breathe

i want to be part of the human race



where do we go from here? 

the words are coming out all wierd 

where are you now when i need you?
