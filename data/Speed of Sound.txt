How long before I get in 
before it starts, before I begin 
how long before you decide 
before I know what it feels like 
where to?
Where do I go? 

if you've never tried then you'll never know 

how long do I have to climb 

up on the side of this mountain of mine 



look up, I look up at night 

planets are moving at the speed of light 

climb up, up in the trees 

every chance that you get 

is a chance you seize 

how long am I gonna can stand 

with my head stuck under the sand 

I'll start before I can stop 

before I see thing the right way up 



all that noise, all that sound 

all those places I got found 

and birds go flying at the speed of sound 

to show you how it all began 

birds came flying from the underground 

if you could see it then you'd understand 



ideas that you'll never find 

or the inventors could never design 

the buildings that you put up 

Japan and China... all lit up 

the sign that I couldn't read 

or the light that I couldn't see 

some things you have to believe 

but others are puzzles, puzzling me 



all that noise, all that sound 

all those places I got found 

and birds go flying at the speed of sound 

to show you how it all began 

birds came flying from the underground 

if you could see it then you'd understand,if you could see it then you'd understand 



all those signs I knew what they meant 

something you can't invent 

Some get made, and some get sent 

ooh 

words go flying at the speed of sound 

to show you how it all began 

birds came flying from the underground 

if you could see it then you'd understand 

oh, when you see it then you'll understand
