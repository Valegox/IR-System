I watched you change 
Into a fly
I looked away 
You were on fire
I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings

Now you feel so alive

I've watched you change



I took you home

Set you on the glass

I pulled off your wings

Then I laughed

I watched a change in you

It's like you never had wings

Now you feel so alive 

I've watched you change



It's like you never had wings...

ahh-ah-aaah (6x)



I look at the cross

Then I look away

Give you the gun

Blow me away



I watched a change in you

It's like you never had wings

Now you feel so alive

I've watched you change

And you feel alive

You feel alive (2x)

I've watched you change



It's like you never had wings... 

ahh-ah-aaah (6x)

You change (3x)

...I'm over...
