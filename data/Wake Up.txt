Somethin' filled up
my heart with nothin',
someone told me not to cry.
But now that I'm older,
my heart's colder,

and I can see that it's a lie.



Children wake up,

hold your mistake up,

before they turn the summer into dust.



If the children don't grow up,

our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up.

We're just a million little god's causin rain storms turnin' every good thing to rust.



I guess we'll just have to adjust.



With my lighnin' bolts a glowin'

I can see where I am goin' to be

when the reaper he reaches and touches my hand.



With my lighnin' bolts a glowin'

I can see where I am goin'

With my lighnin' bolts a glowin'

I can see where I am go-goin'



You better look out below!
