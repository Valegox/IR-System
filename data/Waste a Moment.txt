All the way from Waco to we hold the rabbit on a chain
Drove her little slick car to ten bar with the static on her brain
She's a little burner, burner, gonna throw you to the flame
Yeah, a ticking time bomb, time bomb, gonna blow us all away
Oh, take the time to waste a moment

Oh, never ask to be forgiven



Sexy was her boyfriend, with no kin, always running from the law

Every other weekend, weekends with his back at her claw

He's a live wire, wire, shooting sparks in the night

He's a little higher, higher, with the beat in his sights



Oh, take the time to waste a moment

Oh, face it where the lines are broken

Oh, name a price to all this living

Oh, never ask to be forgiven





Oh, take the time to waste a moment

Oh, face it where the lines are broken

Oh, name a price to all this living

Oh, never ask to be forgiven
