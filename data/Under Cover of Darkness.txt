Slip back out of whack att your best.
It's a nightmare,
So I'm joining the army.
Know how folks back out, I still call.
Will you wait for me now?



We got the righteous advice to use it

Got everything but you can just choose it

I won't just be a puppet on a string



Don't go that way.

I'll wait for you.



And I'm tired of all your friends

Listening at your door

And I won't, I better call you.



So long, my friend and adversary.

But I will call you.



Get dressed, jump out of bed and do it best.

Are you OK?

I've been out around this town

And everybody's been singing the same song ten years.



I'll wait for you.

Will you wait for me too?



And they sacrifice their lives

In our land are all closed eyes.

I've been saying we're beaten down, I won't say it again.

So long, my end.

The sorry embrace.



Don't go that way.

I'll wait for you.



I'm tired of all your friends,

Knocking down your door.

Get up in the morning, give it your all.

So long, my friend and adversary.

I'll wait for you.
