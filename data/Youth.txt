Here I am, stuck on this couch
Scrolling through my notes
Heart was broken, still not growing, nah
Waking up to headlines
Filled with devastation again
My heart is broken

But I keep going



Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate

No, I won't let it change me



Never losing sight of the one I keep inside

Now, I know it

Yeah, I know it



You can't take my youth away

This soul of mine will never break

As long as I wake up today

You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away

This soul of mine will never break

As long as I wake up today

You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away



It's hard to sleep at night

Knowing what's outside

Feeling hopeless

I need focus

You hit me with words I never heard come out your mouth

To be honest, I don't want it, no



Pain, but I wonâ€™t let it turn into hate 

No, I won't let it change me



You can't take my youth away

This soul of mine will never break

As long as I wake up today

You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away

This soul of mine will never break

As long as I wake up today

You can't take my youth away



You can't take my youth away (can't take my youth)

You can't take my youth away

Oh, yeah



Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate

No, I won't let it change me

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate

No, I won't let it change me



You can't take my youth away

This soul of mine will never break

As long as I wake up today

You can't take my youth away (youth away)

You can't take my youth away

This soul of mine will never break

As long as I wake up today

You can't take my youth away (oh yeah)

You can't take my youth away

This soul of mine will never break

As long as I wake up today

You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away

This soul of mine will never break

As long as I wake up today

You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away
