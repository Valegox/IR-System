It's Britney Bitch
I see you, and I just wanna dance with you
Everytime they turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you
You got my display of affection

Feels like no one else in the room (the room) 



We can get down like there's no one around

We keep on rockin, we keep on rockin'

Cameras are flashin' while we're dirty dancin'

They keep watchin, keep watchin'

Feels like the the crowd was sayin



Gimme Gimme more 

Gimme more 

Gimme gimme more (repeat 4)



Center of attention, even when you're up against the wall

You got me in a crazy position (uh huh)

If you're on a mission (ooh)

You got my permission ooohhh



We can get down like there's no one around

We keep on rockin, we keep on rockin'

Cameras are flashin' while we're dirty dancer

They keep watchin, keep watchin'

Feels like the the crowd was sayin



Gimme Gimme more 

Gimme more 

Gimme gimme more (repeat 4)



I just can't control myself, more

They want more? Well I'll give them more (ow!)



Gimme Gimme more 

Gimme more 

Gimme gimme more (repeat 4)



Gimme more gimme more

Gimme more gimme more babe 

I just want more 



Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme...



Bet you didn't see this one coming

The incredible lygo

The legendary Miss Britney Spears

The unstoppable Danja

You gonna have to remove me

'Cause I ain't goin' no where
