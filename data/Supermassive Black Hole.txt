Ooh, baby, don't you know I suffer?
Ooh, baby, can you hear me mourn?
You caught me under false pretences
How long before you let me go?
Ooh ooh ahh, you set my soul alight

Ooh ooh ahh, you set my soul alight



Glaciers melting in the dead of night

And the superstar sucked into the supermasssive (Ooh ooh ahh, you set my soul alight)

Glaciers melting in the dead of night

And the superstar sucked in so...(Ooh ooh ahh, you set my soul...)



I thought I was a fool for no one

But ooh, baby, I'm a fool for you

You're the queen of the superficial

But how long before you tell the truth?



Ooh ooh ahh, you set my soul alight

Ooh ooh ahh, you set my soul alight



Glaciers melting in the dead of night

And the superstar sucked into the supermasssive (Ooh ooh ahh, you set my soul alight)

Glaciers melting in the dead of night

And the superstar sucked in so...(Ooh ooh ahh, you set my soul...)



Supermassive black hole

Supermassive black hole

Supermassive black hole

Supermassive black hole



Glaciers melting in the dead of night

And the superstar sucked into the supermasssive

Glaciers melting in the dead of night

And the superstar sucked into the supermassive



Glaciers melting in the dead of night

And the superstar sucked into the supermasssive (Ooh ooh ahh, you set my soul alight)

Glaciers melting in the dead of night

And the superstar sucked in so...(Ooh ooh ahh, you set my soul...)



Supermassive black hole

Supermassive black hole

Supermassive black hole

Supermassive black hole
