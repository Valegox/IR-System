I got this feelin' inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flyin' up, no ceilin', when we in our zone
I got that sunshine in my pocket, got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, movin' so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (just imagine, just imagine)
Nothin' I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
A feelin' good, good, creepin' up on you, so just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do, but you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leavin' soon, so keep dancin'
I can't stop the feelin'
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feelin'
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
Ooh, it's somethin' magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushin' on (rushin' on)
I don't need no reason, don't need control (need control)
I fly so high, no ceilin', when I'm in my zone
'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket, got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, movin' so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (just imagine, just imagine)
Nothin' I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
A feelin' good, good, creepin' up on you, so just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do, but you dance, dance, dance (no, no, no)
And ain't nobody leavin' soon, so keep dancin'
I can't stop the feelin'
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feelin'
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
I can't stop the feelin' (woo)
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feelin' (yeah)
So keep dancin' (come on)
Oh
Yeah, oh
I can't stop the
I can't stop the
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
(I can't stop the feelin')
Nothin' I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance (I can't stop the feelin')
A feelin' good, good, creepin' up on you, so just dance, dance, dance, come on (I can't stop the feelin')
All those things I shouldn't do, but you dance, dance, dance (I can't stop the feelin')
And ain't nobody leavin' soon, so keep dancin' (I can't stop the feelin')
Everybody sing
Got this feelin' in my body (I can't stop the feelin')
Got this feelin' in my body (oh, no; I can't stop the feelin')
Wanna see you move your body (no, no, no; I can't stop the feelin')
Got this feelin' in my body, come on (break it down)
Got this feelin' in my body (uh; I can't stop the feelin')
Got this feelin' in my body, come on (ooh)
