Busy Earnin'

So, you come a long way
(Huh, woo-hoo)
But you're never out late
Never had plans for a normal life
It's crime, too busy earnin'
You can't get enough
Just busy earnin'
You can't get enough
You think that all your time is used
Too busy earnin'
You can't get enough
And I get it, always
But I bet it won't change, no
Damn, that's a borin' life
It's crime, busy earnin'
You can't get enough
Just busy earnin'
You can't get enough
You think that all your time is used
Too busy earnin'
You can't get enough
Just busy earnin'

You can't get enough

You think that all your time is used
Too busy earnin'
You can't get enough
You think that all your time is used
Too busy earnin'
You can't get enough
Just busy earnin'
You can't get enough, no
Just busy earnin'
You can't get enough
