I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we're young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya
'Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all 'bout you when the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do
'Cause all-

Body rock
Girl, I can feel your body rock
Ay, ay, ay
Take a bow
You're on the hottest ticket now, oh

So just forget about the world, we're young tonight

'Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all 'bout you when the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do (uh)
'Cause all- (uh)
In time, ink lines, bitches couldn't get on my incline
World tours, it's mine, ten little letters on a big sign
Justin Bieber, you know I'ma hit 'em with the ether
Buns out, wiener, but I gotta keep an eye out for Selena
Beauty, beauty and the beast
Beauty from the East, beautiful confessions of the priest
Beast, beauty from the streets, beat will get deceased
Every time beauty on the beat eats
Body rock (yeah, yeah)
Oh, I wanna feel your body rock (yeah, let's go, let's go)
'Cause all (all I need is love) I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete (oh)
It's all (all I needed to) 'bout you when the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do
'Cause all-
