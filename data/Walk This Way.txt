Backstroking lover
Always hiding 'neath the covers
"Can I talk to you?" My daddy would say
He said, "You ain't seen nothing
Until you're down on a muff and
Then you're sure to be a-changing your ways"

I met a cheerleader

Was a real young bleeder

All the times I could reminisce

Cause the best things of loving

With her sister and her cousin

Only started with a little kiss

Like this



See-saw swinging with the boys in the school

With your feet flying up in the air

Singing hey diddle-diddle

With your kitty in the middle

Of the swing like I didn't care

So I took a big chance

At the high school dance

With a missy who was ready to play

Wasn't me she was fooling

Cause she knew what she was doing

And I knew love was here to stay

When she told me to



"Walk this way, walk this way"

"Walk this way, walk this way"

"Walk this way, walk this way"

"Walk this way, walk this way"

Ah, just give me a kiss

Like this



School girl sweetie

With the classy kinda sassy

Little skirt's climbing way up her knee

There was three young ladies

In the school gym locker

When I noticed they was looking at me

I was a high school loser

Never made it with a lady

Till the boys told me something I missed

Then my next door neighbor

With a daughter had a favor

So I gave her a little kiss

Like this



See-saw swinging with the boys in the school

With your feet flying up in the air

Singing hey diddle-diddle

With your kitty in the middle

Of the swing like I didn't care

So I took a big chance

At the high school dance

With a missy who was ready to play

Wasn't me she was fooling

Cause she knew what she was doing

When she taught me how to walk this way

She told me to



"Walk this way, walk this way"

"Walk this way, walk this way"

"Walk this way, walk this way"

"Walk this way, walk this way"

Just give me a kiss
