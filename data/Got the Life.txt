Hate, something, sometime, someway, something kick off the for me.
Something, inside.
I'll never ever follow.
So give me something that is for real.
I'll never ever follow. 


Get your boogie on... 



Hate, something, someway, each day, dealing with no forgiveness.

Why? This shit inside.

Now everyone will follow.

So give me nothingjust feel.

And now this shit will follow. 



Chorus Version 1 



God begs me, the more I see the light, who wants to see?

God told me, I've already got the light, oh I say...

God begs me, the more I see the light, who wants to see?

God told me, I've already got the light, oh I say... 



Chorus Version 2 



God begs me, the more I see the light, who wants to see?

God don't mind, I've already got the light, oh I say...

God begs me, the more I see the light, who wants to see?

God don't mind, I've already got the light, oh I say... 



Each day I can feel it swallow, inside something they took from me.

I don't feel your deathly ways.

Each day i feel so hollow, inside I was beating me,

You will never see, so come dance with me. 



Dance with me

Chorus 



Got the life.
