Uh 
I got a body full of liquor 
With a cocaine kicker 
And I'm feeling like I'm 30 feet tall 

So lay it down, lay it down 



You got your legs up in the sky 

With the devil in your eyes 

Let me hear you say 

You want it all 



Say it now, say it now 



Look what you're doing 

Look what you've done 

But in this jungle you can't run 

Cause what I've got for you 

I promise it's a killer 

You'll be banging on my chest bang bang 

Gorilla! 



Uh uh uh yea 

You and me baby, making love like gorillas 

Uh uh uh yea 

You and me baby, making love like gorillas 



Yea, I've got a fist full of your hair 

But you don't look like you're scared 

You just smile and tell me daddy it's yours 

Cuz you know how I like it, you's a dirty little lover 



If the neighbors call the cops, call the sheriff 

Call the SWAT, we don't stop 

We keep rocking while they knocking on our door 

And you're screaming give it to me baby, give it to me motherfucker 



Oh look what you're doing 

Look what you've done 

But in this jungle you can't run 

Cause what I've got for you 

I promise it's a killer 

You'll be banging on my chest bang bang 

Gorilla! 



Uh uh uh yea 

You and me baby, making love like gorillas 

Uh uh uh yea 

You and me baby, making love like gorillas 



I bet you never ever felt so good, so good 

I got your body trembling like it should, it should 

You'll never be the same, baby once I'm done with you uh uh uh 



You uh! 

You uh! 

You uh! 



Oh You and me baby, making love like gorillas 



Uh uh uh yea 

You and me baby, we'll be fucking like gorillas 

Uh uh uh yea 

You and me baby, making love like gorillas
