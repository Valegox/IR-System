It's 4AM, I don't know where to go
Everywhere is closed, I should just go home, yeah
My feet are taking me to your front door
I know I shouldn't though, heaven only knows that
Oh, the side effect to my loneliness is you

Oh, you're all that I want

No good at giving you up

Come on and give me some love tonight

Oh, you're all that I want

No good at giving you up

Come on and give me some love tonight



This happens every time I try to mix

Decision making with one too many drinks but

Oh, if late night friends have consequences, cool yeah



Oh, you're all that I want

No good at giving you up

Come on and give me some love tonight

Oh, you're all that I want

No good at giving you up

Come on and give me some love tonight



Oh, I think about it all the time

Make it happen in my mind, I'm telling you, yeah

Oh, you're all that I want

No good at giving you up

Come on and give me some love tonight



Time should've taught me the lesson

When looking for a sign, but instead I got a message

I take off my pride every time we undressing

Draw the line, I'm by the line, yeah

Time should've taught me the lesson

When looking for a sign, but instead I got a message

I take off my pride every time we undressing

Draw the line, I'm by the line



Oh, you're all that I want

No good at giving you up

Come on and give me some love tonight, yeah

Oh, you're all that I want

No good at giving you up

Come on and give me some love tonight, yeah



I, I think about it all the time

Make it happen in my mind, I'm telling you, yeah

Oh, you're all that I want

No good at giving you up

Come on and give me some love tonight



Time should've taught me the lesson

When looking for a sign, but instead I got a message

I take off my pride every time we undressing

Draw the line, I'm by the line, yeah

Time should've taught me the lesson
