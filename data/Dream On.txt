Every time that I look in the mirror
all these lines on my face getting clearer
the past is gone
it went by like dusk to dawn
isn't that the way
everybody's got their dues in life to pay



Yeah, I know nobody knows

where it comes and where it goes

I know it's everybody's sin

you got to lose to know how to win



Half my life is books, written pages

live and learn from fools and from sages

you know it's true

all the things come back to you



Sing with me, sing for the years

sing for the laughter and sing for the tears

sing with me, if it's just for today

maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away



Yeah, sing with me, sing for the years

sing for the laughter, sing for the tears

sing with me, if it's just for today

maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away



Dream on, dream on, dream on,

dream yourself a dream come true

dream on, dream on, dream on,

and dream until your dream comes true

dream on

dream on

dream on

dream on

dream on

dream on

dream on



Sing with me, sing for the years

sing for the laughter, sing for the tears

sing with me, if it's just for today

maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

sing with me, sing for the years 

sing for the laughter, sing for the tears

sing with me, if it's just for today

maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
