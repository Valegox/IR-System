He seemed impressed by the way you came in 
Tell us a story, I know you're not boring 
I was afraid that you would not insist 
You sound so sleepy 
Just take this, now leave me 



I said, "please don't slow me down if i'm going too fast?" 

You're in a strange part of our town 



Yeah, the night's not over 

You're not trying hard enough 

Our lives have changing lanes have ran me off the road 

The wait is over, I'm now taking over 

You're no longer laughing 

Now I'm not driving fast enough 



Now every time that I look at myself 

I thought I told you this world is not for you 



The room is on fire as she's fixing her hair 

You sound so angry 

Just calm down, you found me 

I said, "please don't slow me down" 

"Am I going too fast?" 

You're in a strange part of our town 



Yeah, the night's not over 

You're not trying hard enough 

Our lives have changed 

And the lanes have ran me off the road 

The wait is over, I'm now taking over 

You're no longer laughing 

Now I'm not driving fast enough
