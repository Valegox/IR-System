Come as you are, as you were, 
As I want you to be 
As a friend, as a friend, as an old enemy. 
Take your time, hurry up 
The choice is yours, don't be late. 
Take a rest, as a friend, as an old memoria

Come dowsed in mud, soaked in bleach 

As I want you to be 

As a trend, as a friend, as an old enemy, yeah

And I swear that I don't have a gun 

No, I don't have a gun
