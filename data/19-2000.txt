The world is spinning too fast
I'm buying lead Nike shoes
To keep myself tethered
To the days I try to lose
My mama said to slow down

You must make your own shoes

Stop dancing to the music

Of Gorillaz in a happy mood



Keep a mild groove on



Ba ba ba

Day dee bop



There you go!

Get the cool!

Get the cool shoeshine!

Get the cool!

Get the cool shoeshine!

Get the cool!

Get the cool shoeshine!

Get the cool!

Get the cool shoeshine!



There's a monkey in the jungle

Watching a vapour trail

Caught up in the conflict

Between his brain and his tail



And if time's elimination

Then we got nothing to lose

Please repeat the message

It's the music that we choose



Keep a mild groove on



Ba ba ba

Day dee bop



OK bring it down yeah we gonna break out

Get the cool!

Get the cool shoeshine!

Get the cool!

Get the cool shoeshine!

Get the cool!

Get the cool shoeshine!

Get the cool!

Get the cool shoeshine!



Ah Ah Ah Ah



Day doo de bop
