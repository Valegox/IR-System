Illusion
Illusion

Searching for a destiny that is mine
There is another place, another time
Touching any heart along the way yeah
Hoping that I all never have to say
It is just illusion ooh, aoh, ooh, ooh, ahah
Illusion ooh, aoh, ooh, ooh, ah ah, illusion
Follow your emotions, everywhere
There is a bit of magic in the air
Never let your feelings get you down
Open up your eyes and look around
It is just illusion ooh, aoh, ooh, ooh, ahah
Illusion ooh, aoh, ooh, ooh, ah ah,illusion
Could it be that, it is just an illusion
Putting me back, in all this confusion
Could it be that, it is just an illusion
Ahhhh
Could it be that, it is just an illusion
Putting me back, in all this confusion
Could it be that, it is just an illusion
Ahhhh
Could it be a picture in my mind
Never sure exactly what I all find
Only in my dreams I turn you on
Here for just a moment then you are gone
It is just illusion ooh, aoh, ooh, ooh, ah ah
Illusion ooh, aoh, ooh, ooh, ah ah, illusion

Ooh, aoh, ooh, ooh, ah ah, illusion
Ooh, aoh, ooh, ooh, ah ah, illusion
Ooh, aoh, ooh, ooh, ah ah, illusion
Ooh, aoh, ooh, ooh, ah ah, illusion
Could it be that, it is just an illusion
Putting me back, in all this confusion
Could it be that, it is just an illusion
Ahhhh
Could it be that, it's just an illusion
Putting me back, in all this confusion
Could it be that, it is just an illusion
Ahhhh
