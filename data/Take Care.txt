Step beside of me
You can hide the way you make us glow
It's no good unless it glows
Feelings burning
Lover while


Deep inside the ever spinning

Tell me does it feel

It's no good unless it's real

Insides burning

Wild eye turning

Tin wheel running from it



I'll take care of you

If you ask me to



You stay swiming in the lake

We come across a snake

It is real and then its fake

Feel its heartbeat

Feel what you heed

For so fast it feels too late



I'll take care of you

Take care of you

That's true
