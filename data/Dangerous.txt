You take me down
Spin me around
You got me running all the lights
Don't make a sound
Talk to me now
Let me inside your mind

Don't know what you're thinking, sugar

But I just got that feeling sugar

And I can hear sirens burning red

Lights turning

I can't turn back now



So hold on tight

I don't know where the lights are taking us

But something in the night is dangerous

And nothing's holding back the two of us

But baby this is getting serious

Oh oh oh

Da da da dangerous

Oh oh oh



Show me your soul

I gotta know

Bet that you're beautiful inside

Toes on the grass

Coming fast

Come take the wheel and drive



I don't know what you're thinking, sugar

But I just got that feeling sugar

And I can hear sirens burning red

Lights turning

I can't turn back now



So hold on tight

I don't know where the lights are taking us

But something in night is dangerous

And nothing's holding back the two of us

But baby this is getting serious

Oh oh oh

Da da da dangerous

Oh oh oh

Da da da dangerous



It's dangerous, so dangerous

I wanna do it again

Come on baby

It's dangerous, so dangerous

I wanna do it again

It's dangerous, so dangerous

I wanna do it again



I don't know where the lights are taking us

But something in the night is dangerous

And nothing's holding back the two of us

But baby this is getting serious

Oh oh oh

Da da da dangerous

Oh oh oh

Da da da dangerous
