You take your white finger
Slide the nail under the top and bottom buttons of my blazer
Relax the fraying wool, slacken ties
And I'm not to look at you in the shoe, but the eyes, find the eyes
Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files

You must follow, leave this academic factory

You will find me in the matinee

The dark of the matinee

It's better in the matinee

The dark of the matinee is mine

Yes it's mine



I time every journey to bump into you, accidentally

I charm you and tell you of the boys I hate

All the girls I hate

All the words I hate

All the clothes I hate

How I'll never be anything I hate

You smile, mention something that you like

How you'd have a happy life if you did the things you like



Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files

You must follow, leave this academic factory

You will find me in the matinee

The dark of the matinee

It's better in the matinee

The dark of the matinee is mine

Yes it's mine



So I'm on BBC2 now, telling Terry Wogan how I made it

What I made is unclear, but his deference is and his laughter is

My words and smile are so easy now

Yes, It's easy now

Yes, It's easy now



Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files

You must follow, leave this academic factory

You will find me in the matinee

The dark of the matinee

It's better in the matinee

The dark of the matinee is mine

Yes it's mine
