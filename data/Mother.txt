He's such a nice boy, so well-mannered
He's so much better than the last one you brought around
Please and thank you, everything matters
I'm gonna make sure that she knows I'm the best she's found
The moment she walks out that door

I'm not pretending anymore



If your mother knew all of the things that we do

If your mother knew all the things we do

If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you

If your mother knew all the things we do



Sneak out the window, pass over pillows

I'll be waiting in the car right around the block

Back of the Benzo (Back of the Benzo)

More than a friend zone (More than a friend zone)

We've been hiding since the time they forgot to knock



The moment she walks out that door (She walks out the door)

I'm not pretending anymore



If your mother knew all of the things that we do (Yeah)

If your mother knew (If your mother)

All the things we do (All that we do)

If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you

If your mother knew (Oh) all the things we do



Next time that she sees me

She gon' act like she don't know me

'Cause she knows all of the story

Now your daddy wants to kill me (Ah)

Next time that she sees me

She gon' act like she don't know me

'Cause she knows all of the story

Now your daddy wants to kill me (Yeah, yeah)

If your mother only knew (Ooh)



The moment she walks out that door

I'm not pretending anymore



If your mother knew all of the things that we do

If your mother knew all the things we do (We do)

If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you

If your mother knew all the things we do (From you, oh)



Next time that she sees me (Hey)

She gon' act like she don't know me (Does she know me?)

'Cause she knows all of the story

Now your daddy wants to kill me (Yeah)

Next time that she sees me

She gon' act like she don't know me

'Cause she knows all of the story

Now your daddy wants to kill me (Yeah)



If your mother knew all the things we do

If your mother knew all the things we do

If your mother knew all of the things that we do
