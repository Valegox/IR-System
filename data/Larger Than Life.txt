I may run and hide 
when you're screaming my name, alright
But let me tell you now 
there are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent

In flashes of light



All you people can't you see, can't you see

How your love's affecting our reality

Every time we're down, you can make it right

And that makes you larger than life



Looking at the crowd 

and I see your body sway, come on

Wishing I could thank you 

in a different way, come on, cause



All of your time spent

Keeps us alive



All you people can't you see, can't you see

How your love's affecting our reality

Every time we're down, you can make it right

And that makes you larger than life



All of your time spent

Keeps us alive



All you people, can't you see, can't you see

How your love's affecting our reality

Every time we're down, you can make it right

And that makes you larger than life



Yeah, every time we are down

Yeah, you can make it right

Yeah, and that is what makes you larger than life
