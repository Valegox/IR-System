Trapped in a prism
In a prism of light
Alone in the darkness
Darkness of white
We fell in love
Alone on a stage

In the reflective age



Entre le nuit, le nuit et l'aurore.

Entre les voyants, les vivants et les morts.



If this is heaven

I don't know what it's for

If I can't find you there

I don't care



I thought I found a way to enter

It's just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

I thought I found the connector

It's just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)



The signals we send

Are deflected again

We're still connected

But are we even friends?



We fell in love when I was nineteen

And I was staring at a screen



Entre le nuit, le nuit et l'aurore.

Entre les voyants, les vivants et les morts.



If this is heaven

I need something more

Just a place to be alone

Cause you're my home???



I thought I found a way to enter

It's just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

I thought I found the connector

It's just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)



It's just a reflection of a reflection

Of a reflection of a reflection



Will I see you on the other side?

We all got things to hide



It's just a reflection of a reflection

Of a reflection of a reflection



Will I see you on the other side?

We all got things to hide



Alright, let's go back



Our song escapes

On neon silver discs

Our love is plastic

We'll break it to bits



I want to break free

But will they break me?

Down, down, down

Don't mess around



I thought I found a way to enter

It's just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

I thought I found the connector

It's just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)



Thought you would bring me to the ressurector

Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

Thought you would bring to me the ressurector

Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

Thought you would bring to me the ressurector

Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)



It's a Reflektor

It's just a Reflektor

Just a Reflektor



Will I see you on the other side?



It's just a Reflektor



Will I see you on the other side?

We all got things to hide



It's just a Reflektor



Will I see you on the other side?
