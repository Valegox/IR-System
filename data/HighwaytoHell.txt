Highway to Hell

Living easy, living free
Season ticket on a one-way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I'd rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too, oh
I'm on the highway to Hell
Highway to Hell
(I'm on the) highway to Hell
Highway to Hell
No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down (no more)
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey Satan, paying my dues
I'm playing in a rocking band
Hey mama, look at me
I'm on my way to the promised land
I'm on the highway to Hell
Highway to Hell
I'm on the highway to Hell
Highway to Hell
Don't stop me
Yeah!

All your roads are ruined
On the highway to Hell
I'm gonna bring all my friends
Highway to Hell
I'm on the highway to Hell
Highway to Hell
Highway to (Hell)
We're on the highway to Hell
(Don't you stop me now, no, no, no) highway to Hell
Highway to Hell
(Oh yes) highway
Highway to Hell
I'm going
I'm gonna go down
I'm on the highway
I'm on the highway
On the highway
