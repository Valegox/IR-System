You fall, my pride,
Don't ever need t'apologize,
As your lips unfold,
Shakin' purple from the cold
You better learn to crawl,

You better learn to crawl,

Before I walk away,

Before I walk away



You broke, my mouth,

The bloody bits are spittin' out

Your grave, unscathed,

The worm is countin' down the day



He wants to see you crawl,

He wants to see you crawl,

Before I walk away,

Before I walk away



The reds and the whites and abused,

The crucified USA,

I said the prophecy unfolds,

All hell is surely on its way



Cuz the rat and the fly,

They're searchin' for an alibi,

As we wait the wrath,

They never went to Sunday mass



They want to see us crawl,

They want to see us crawl,

Before they walk away,

Before they walk away



The reds and the whites and abused,

The crucified USA,

I said the prophecy unfolds,

All hell is surely on its way
