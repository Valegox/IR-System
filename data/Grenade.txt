Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live, oh
Take take take it all
But you never give
Should've known you was trouble
From the first kiss

Had your eyes wide open

Why were they open?



Gave you all I had

And you tossed it in the trash

You tossed it in the trash, you did

To give me all your love

Is all I ever asked

Cause what you don't understand

Is I'd catch a grenade for ya 

(yeah, yeah, yeah)

Throw my hand on the blade for ya 

(yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'd jump in front of a train for ya 

(yeah, yeah, yeah)

You know I'd do anything for ya 

(yeah, yeah, yeah)



I would go through all this pain

Take a bullet straight through my brain

Yes I would die for you, baby

But you won't do the same

No, no, no, no



Black, black, black and blue

Beat me till I'm numb

Tell the devil I said 

hey when you get back to where you're from

Bad woman, bad woman

That's just what you are

Yeah, you smile in my face 

then rip the breaks out my car



Gave you all I had

And you tossed it in the trash

You tossed it in the trash, yes you did

To give me all your love

Is all I ever asked

Cause what you don't understand

Is I'd catch a grenade for ya 

(yeah, yeah, yeah)

Throw my hand on the blade for ya 

(yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'd jump in front of a train for ya 

(yeah, yeah, yeah)

You know I'd do anything for ya 

(yeah, yeah, yeah)



I would go through all this pain

Take a bullet straight through my brain

Yes I would die for you, baby

But you won't do the same



If my body was on fire

You would watch me burn down in flames

You said you loved me, you're a liar

Cause you never ever ever did, baby



But darling, I'd still catch a grenade for ya 

Throw my hand on the blade for ya

I'd jump in front of a train for ya

You know I'd do anything for ya



I would go through all this pain

Take a bullet straight through my brain

Yes I would die for ya baby

But you won't do the same

No, you won't do the same

Oh, you never do the same

You never do the same, no, no, no, no
