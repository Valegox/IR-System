I, I can't get this memories out of my mind,

it's some kind of madness, it started to evolve



m-m-m-m-m-mad-mad-mad

m-m-m-m-m-mad-mad-mad



I, I tried so hard to let you go

But some kind of Madness is swallowing me whole. 



m-m-m-m-m-mad-mad-mad

m-m-m-m-m-mad-mad-mad



I have finally seen the light

And I have finally realized

What you mean



And now, I need to know: is this real love?

Or is it just Madness keeping us afloat?



m-m-m-m-m-mad-mad-mad

m-m-m-m-m-mad-mad-mad



But when I look back at all the crazy fights we had

It's like some kind of Madness, was taking control.



m-m-m-m-m-mad-mad-mad

m-m-m-m-m-mad-mad-mad



And now I have finally seen the light

And I have finally realized

What you need



m-m-m-m-m-mad-mad-mad

m-m-m-m-m-mad-mad-mad



And now I have finally seen the end 

(finally seen the end)

I'm not expecting you to care 

(expecting you to care)

And I have finally seen the light 

(finally seen the light)

And I have finally realized

I need your Love

I need your Love



Come to me, just in a dream

Come on and rescue me

Yes I know, I can't be wrong

And maybe I'm too headstrong

Our love isÂ…
