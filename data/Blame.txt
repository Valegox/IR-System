Can't be sleepin'
Keep on waking
Is that the woman next to me?
Guilt is burning
Inside I'm hurting
This ain't a feeling I can keep

So blame it on the night

Don't blame it on me

Don't blame it on me

Blame it on the night

Don't blame it on me

Don't blame it on me



Blame it on the night

Don't blame it on me

Don't blame it on me

So blame it on the night

Don't blame it on me

Don't blame it on me

Don't blame it on me



Can't you see

I was manipulated by it

Who let her through the door

I had no choice in this

I was the friend she missed

She needed me to talk

So blame it on the night

Don't blame it on me

Don't blame it on me

Blame it on the night

Don't blame it on me

Don't blame it on me



Blame it on the night

Don't blame it on me

Don't blame it on me

So blame it on the night

Don't blame it on me

Don't blame it on me

Don't blame it on me



No one saw something

Start a thing

Yeah

I got defense

Oh I promise 

(I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)

Oh I promise 

(I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)



Don't blame it on me

Don't blame it on me
