Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And trading jackets
Laughing 'bout how small it looks on you (Ah-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein’ annoying, singing in harmony

I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, saying you’re so unique (Hm)



So when you gonna tell her that we did that too?

She thinks it's special, but it's all re-used

That was our place, I found it first

I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you



Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?

Do you get déjà vu, hmm? (Ha)

Do you get déjà vu, huh?



Do you call her, almost say my name?

'Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same

Another actress

I hate to think that I was just your type

And I bet that she knows Billy Joel

'Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"

You’re singing it together

Now I bet you even tell her how you love her

In between the chorus and the verse



So when you gonna tell her that we did that too?

She thinks it’s special, but it's all re-used

That was the show we talked about

Played you the songs she’s singing now when she's with you



Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?

Do you get déjà vu? (Huh)

Do you get déjà vu?



Strawberry ice cream in Malibu

Don't act like we didn’t do that shit too

You're trading jackets like we used to do

(Yeah, everything is all re-used)

Play her piano, but she doesn't know

That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel

A different girl now, but there's nothing new



I know you get déjà vu

I know you get déjà vu

I know you get déjà vu
