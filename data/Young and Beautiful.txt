I've seen the world
Done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant
In bel air now
Hot summer nights, 

Mid july

When you and I were forever wild

The crazy days

City lights

The way you'd play with me like a child



Will you still love me

When I'm no longer young and beautiful?

Will you still love me

When I've got nothing but my aching soul?

I know you will

I know you will

I know that you will

Will you still love me 

When I'm no longer beautiful?



I've seen the world, lit it up

As my stage now

Changeling angels in a new age now

Hot summer days

Rock 'n' roll

The way you play for me at your show

And all the ways 

I got to know

Your pretty face and electric soul



Will you still love me

When I'm no longer young and beautiful?

Will you still love me

When I've got nothing but my aching soul?

I know you will

I know you will

I know that you will

Will you still love me

When I'm no longer beautiful?



Dear lord, when I get to heaven

Please let me bring my man

When he comes tell me that you'll let him

Father tell me if you can

All that grace

All that body

All that face

Makes me wanna party

He's my sun

He makes me shine like diamonds



And will you still love me

When I'm no longer young and beautiful?

Will you still love me

When I've got nothing but my aching soul?

I know you will

I know you will

I know that you will

Will you still love me 

When I'm no longer beautiful?

Will you still love me

When I'm no longer beautiful?

Will you still love me

When I'm not young and beautiful?
