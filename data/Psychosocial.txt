(Oh Yea) I did my time, and I want out
So effusive
Fade
It doesn't cut,
The soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening

Packaging subversion

Pseudo-sacrosanct perversion

Go drill your deserts,

Go dig your graves

Then fill your mouth

With all the money you will save

Sinking in, getting smaller again

Im done, it has begun

I'm not the only one



And the rain will kill us all,

Throw ourselves against the wall

But no one else can see,

The preservation of the martyr in me



Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial

Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial



Oh, there are cracks, in the road we laid

But where the temple fell,

The secrets have gone mad!

This is nothing new,

But when we kill it all,

The hate was all we had!

Who needs another mess?

We could start over!

Just look me in the eyes

And say I'm wrong

Now there's only emptiness...

Venomous, insipid!

I think we're done

I'm not the only one!



And the rain will kill us all,

Throw ourselves against the wall

But no one else can see,

The preservation of the martyr in me



Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial

Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial



THE LIMITS OF THE DEAD!

THE LIMITS OF THE DEAD!

THE LIMITS OF THE DEAD!

THE LIMITS OF THE DEAD!



Fake Anti-Fascist Lie,

(Psychosocial),

I tried to tell you,

(Psychosocial),

But your purple hearts are giving out,

(Psychosocial),

Can't stop the killing idea,

(Psychosocial),

If it's hunting season,

(Psychosocial),

Is this what you want?,

(Psychosocial),

I'm not the only one!



And the rain will kill us all,

Throw ourselves against the wall

But no one else can see,

The preservation of the martyr in me



And the rain will kill us all,

Throw ourselves against the wall

But no one else can see,

The preservation of the martyr in me.
