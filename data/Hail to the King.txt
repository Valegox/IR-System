Watch your tongue or have it cut from your head
Save your life by keeping whispers unsaid
Children roam the streets now orphans of war
Bodies hanging in the streets to adore
Royal flames will carve the path in chaos
Bringing daylight to the night

Death is rotting in the town with armor

Because they take all your rights



Hail to the king, hail to the one

Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun

Hail to the king



Blood is spilled while holding keys to the throne

Born again, but it's too late to atone

No mercy from the edge of the blade

They'll escape and learn the price to be paid

Let the water throw it's shades of red now

Arrows black out all the light

Death is rotting in the town with armor

They've come to grant you your rights



Hail to the king, hail to the one

Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun

Hail to the king



There's a taste of fear

When the henchmen call

I refuse to tame it

I refuse to claim it all



Hail to the king, hail to the one

Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun

Hail to the king, hail to the one

Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun

Hail of the king
