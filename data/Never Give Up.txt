I've battled demons that won't let me sleep
Called to the sea but she abandoned me
But I will never give up, no, never give up, no, no
No, I will never give up, no, never give up, no, no

And I won't let you get me down

I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground

Oh, I'll never give up, no, I'll never give up no, no, oh

I won't let you get me down

I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground

Oh, I'll never give up, no, I'll never give up no, no, oh



I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh

I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh

I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh

I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh



Oh yeah, I'm haunted by the distant past

Called to the skies but she was overcast



But I will never give up, no, never give up, no, no

No, I will never give up, no, never give up, no, no



And I won't let you get me down

I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground

Oh, I'll never give up, no, I'll never give up no, no, oh

I won't let you get me down

I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground

Oh, I'll never give up, no, I'll never give up no, no, oh



I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh

I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh

I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh

I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh



Never give up, never give up

Never give up, never give up, no, no, oooh



And I won't let you get me down

I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground

Oh, I'll never give up, no, I'll never give up no, no, oh

I won't let you get me down

I'll keep gettin' up when I hit the ground

Oh, I'll never give up, no, I'll never give up no, no, oh



I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh

I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh

I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh

I'll find my way, find my way home, oh, oh, oh
