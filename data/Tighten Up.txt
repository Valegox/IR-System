I wanted love, i needed love
Most of all, most of all...
Someone said "rue love are dead"
But i'm bound to fall for you.

Oh what can i do?



Take my badge, but my hearts remain

Loving you, babe, child...



Tighten up on your reigns, you're running wild.



Running wild. It's true.



Sick for days...



So many ways...



I'm aching now, i'm aching now...



It's time like these, i need relief.

Please show me how, show me how...



Together...



When i was young, and moving fast,

Nothing slowed me down, slowed me down.



Now i let the other pass,

I've come around, come around.



'Couse i found.



Living just to keep going

Going just to be sane.



All the wile i know

It's such a shame.



I don't need to get steady,

I know just what to feel.



Telling me to be ready, my dear.
