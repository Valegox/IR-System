Hey, pretty baby, with the high heels on

You give me fever, like I've never, ever known
You're just a product of, loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for me
The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)
I like the feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me baby and I'm in ecstasy

Oh, I'll be workin' from nine to five
To buy ya things to keep you by my side
I never felt so in love before
Just promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me
The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet, now baby
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)
Acha-ooh

I never felt so in love before

Promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me
The way you make me feel

You really turn me on

You knock me off of my feet, now baby
