I can't see you mama 
but I know you're always there 
ooh to touch and to feel you mama 
oh I just can't keep away 
it's the heat and the steam of the city 
oh its got me running and I just can't brake 

so say you'll help me mama 

cos its getting so hard 



Now I can't keep you mama 

but I know you're always there 

you listen, you teach me mama 

and I know inside you care 

so get down, down here beside me 

oh you ain't going nowhere 

no I won't hurt you mama 

but its getting so hard 



Can't you see me mama 

mama mama mama please 

can't you feel my heart 

can't you feel my heart 

can't you feel my heart ooh 

listen to me mama 

mama mama 

you're taking away any last chances 

don't take it away 

can't you feel my heart?.. 



It's hot, too hot for me mama 

but I can't hardly wait 

my eyes they're burning mama 

make the pain, make it go away 

no I won't hurt you mama 

but its getting so hard 



Now I can't see you mama 

but I know you're always there 

you taunt, you tease me mama 

but I never never cen keep away 

it's the heat and the steam of the city
