I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm beggin' you to beg me
I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'll shine up my old brown shoes
I'll put on a brand new shirt
I'll get home early from work
If you say that you love me
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'
Ohh didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'
Feelin' all alone without a friend you know you feel like dyin'
Ohh didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'
I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm beggin' you to beg me
I'll shine up my old brown shoes
I'll put on a brand new shirt
I'll get home early from work
If you say that you love me
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
See you cryin' (cryin', cryin')
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
See you cryin' (cry, cry')
Feelin' all alone without a friend
You know you feel like dyin'
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
See you cry
Feelin' all alone without a friend
You know you feel like dyin'
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
See you cryin'
I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm beggin' you to beg me
