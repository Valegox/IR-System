Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down
Oh I'll never know
What makes this man
With all the love

That his heart can stand

Dream of ways

To throw it all away



Gravity is working against me

And gravity wants to bring me down



Oh twice as much

Ain't twice as good

And can't sustain

Like one half could

It's wanting more

That's gonna send me to my knees





Oh twice as much

Ain't twice as good

And can't sustain

Like one half could

It's wanting more

That's gonna send me to my knees



Oh gravity, stay the hell away from me

And gravity has taken better men than me

Now how can that be?



Just keep me where the light is

Just keep me where the light is

Just keep me where the light is

Come on, keep me where the light is

Come on, keep me where the light is

Come on, keep me where keep me where the light is
