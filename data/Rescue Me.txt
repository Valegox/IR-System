Would you rescue me?
Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Huh
Would you rescue me?
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?

When I need your love, if I need your help

Would you rescue me? Huh

Would you rescue me?



We don't talk much, not anymore

Broken bottles and slammin' doors

But we still care about each other

Say we care about each other

I know laughter gets far away

But I still dream 'bout the good old days

When we took care of each other

We were living for each other



But I start to wonder, wonder

If I'm flipping under, under (Oh, oh)



Would you rescue me?

Would you get my back?

Would you take my call when I start to crack?

Would you rescue me? Huh

Would you rescue me?

Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?

When I need your love, if I need your help

Would you rescue me? Huh

Would you rescue me?

Would you rescue me?

Would you get my back?

Would you take my call when I start to crack?

Would you rescue me? Huh

Would you rescue me? (Would you rescue me?)

Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?

When I need your love, if I need your help

Would you rescue me? Huh

Would you rescue me?



Yeah, I miss all the times we had

Can't forget what you can't get back

And you can't find it in another

Man, time, it ain't your lover

I don't care what you thought before

I'll be there anytime you call

Don't you ever call another

No need to call another



And I start to wonder, wonder

If I'm flipping under, under (Oh, oh)



Would you rescue me?

Would you get my back?

Would you take my call when I start to crack?

Would you rescue me? Huh

Would you rescue me? (Would you rescue me?)

Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?

When I need your love, if I need your help

Would you rescue me? Huh

Would you rescue me? Yeah



Would you rescue me?

Oh, that's on me (Would your rescue me?)

Would you rescue me?

Oh, that's on me (Would your rescue me?)



Would you rescue me?

Would you get my back?

Would you take my call when I start to crack?

Would you rescue me? Huh

Would you rescue me?

Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?

When I need your love, if I need your help

Would you rescue me? Huh

Would you rescue me?
