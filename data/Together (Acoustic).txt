Ooh, together
We can take it higher
I can hear the thunder
Coming from your mouth
And I know my number's up

Give me some Stevie Wonder

Quick, put it on before we go under



I can see the lightning

Coming from your ears

Yeah, I see you're frightened

I can see the lion

Sleeps tonight in the tears you're crying



Oh, you can't love me unless you love you too

Treat yourself like nothin' but a fool

Can't love me unless you love you too

Love you too



Come now set the past on fire

Stand up raise your face to the sky, my love

Together, we can take it higher

Oh, together, we can take it higher

Come now set the past on fire

Stand up raise your face to the sky, my love

Together, we can take it higher

Oh, together, we can take it higher



I can see the rainbow

Coming from your heart and it's all ok so

Come now, see you're my angel

So say "Bye" to the past, "Hello" to tomorrow



Oh, you can't love me unless you love you too

Treat yourself like nothing but a fool

Can't love me unless you love you too

Love you too



Come now set the past on fire

Stand up raise your face to the sky, my love

Together, we can take it higher

Oh, together, we can take it higher

Come now set the past on fire

Stand up raise your face to the sky, my love

Together, we can take it higher

Oh, together, we can take it higher



I want love, I want to give it

I want love, please deliver it

I want love, I want to give it

I want love, please deliver it

I want love, I want to give it

I want love, please deliver it

I want love, I want to give it

I want love, please deliver it



Come now set the past on fire

Stand up raise your face to the sky, my love

Together, we can take it higher

Oh, together, we can take it higher

Come now set the past on fire

Stand up raise your face to the sky, my love

Together, we can take it higher

Oh, together, we can take it higher



Ooh, together, we can take it higher

Ooh, together, we can take it higher

Ooh, together, we can take it higher

Ooh, together, we can take it higher
