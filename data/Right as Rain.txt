Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're all on your own
You can say I chose to be alone

Who want to be right as rain

It's harder when you're on top



Cause when hard work don't pay off

And I'm tired there aint no room in my bed

As far as I'm concerned

So wipe that dirty smile off

We won't be making up

I've cried my heart out

And now I've had enough of love



Who wants to be riding high

when you'll just crumble back on down

You give up everything you are

And even then you don't get far

They make believe that everything

Is exactly what it seems

But at least when your at your worst

You know how to feel things



See when hard work don't pay off

And I'm tired there aint no room in my bed

As far as I'm concerned

So wipe that dirty smile off

We won't be making up

I've cried my heart out

And now I've had enough of love



Go ahead and steal my heart 

To make me cry again

Cause it will never hurt

as much as it did then

When we were both right

And no one had blame

But now I give up

On this endless game



Cause who wants to be right as rain

It's better when something is wrong

i get excitement in your bones

Even thought everything's a strain

When night comes and I'm all on my own

You should know I chose to be alone

So who want to be right as rain

It's harder when your on top



Cause when hard work don't pay off

And I'm tired there aint no room in my bed

As far as I'm concerned

So wipe that dirty smile off

We won't be making up

I've cried my heart out

And now I've had enough of love
