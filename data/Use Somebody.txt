(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I've been roaming around, 

I was looking down at all I see

painted faces, 

fill the places I can't reach



You know that I could use somebody...

you know that I could use somebody...



Someone like you 

and all you know 

and how you speak

countless lovers 

undercover of the streets



You know that I could use somebody...

you know that I could use somebody...



Someone like you



(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [wha-ah-ah]

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [wha-ah-ah]

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)



Off in the night, 

while you live it up, 

I'm off to sleep

waging wars to shape 

the poet and the beat



I hope it's going to make you notice...

I hope it's going to make you notice...



Someone like me...

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Someone like me...

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) someone like me... somebody...

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) [wha-ah-ah]

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)



(I'm ready now, I'm ready now

I'm ready now, I'm ready now

I'm ready now, I'm ready now

I'm ready now)



. . . . . .

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Someone like you... somebody

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Someone like you... somebody

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Someone like you... somebody

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)



I've been running around, I was looking down at all I see...
