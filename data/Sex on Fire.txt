Lay where you're laying
Don't make a sound
I know they're watching
They're watching
All the commotion

the killing of pain

Has people talking

Talking



You

Your sex is on fire



The dark of the alley

The break of the day

Ahead while I'm driving

I'm driving



Soft lips are open

Them knuckles are pale

Feels like you're dying

You're dying



You

Your sex is on fire

And so

Were the words to transpire



Hot as a fever

Rattling bones

I could just taste it

Taste it



But it's not forever

But it's just tonight 

Oh we're still the greatest

The greatest

The greatest



You 

your sex is on fire



You 

Your sex is on fire



And so

Were the words to transpire



And You 

Your sex is on fire



And so

Were the words to transpire
