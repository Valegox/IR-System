You were a child
Crawling on your knees toward him
Making momma so proud
But your voice is too loud
We like to watch you laughing

You picking insects off of plants

No time to think of consequences



(Chorus)

Control yourself

Take only what you need from him

A family of trees wanting to be haunted

Control yourself

Take only what you need from him

A family of trees following

Be positive



The water is warm

But it's sending me shivers

A baby is born

Crying out for attention

Memories fade

Like looking through a fogged mirror

Decisions too

Decisions are made

Decisions are made and not bought

But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot

I guess not



Chorus x6
