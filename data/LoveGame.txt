Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
I wanna kiss you

But if I do then I might miss you, babe

It's complicated and stupid

Got my ass squeezed by sexy cupid

Guess he wants to play, wants to play

A love game, A love game



Hold me and love me

Just want touch you for a minute

Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it



Let's have some fun, this beat is sick

I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Don't think too much, just bust that kick

I wanna take a ride on your disco stick



Let's play a love game, play a love game

Do you want love, or you want fame

are you in the game?

Dans the love game

Let's play a love game, play a love game

Do you want love, or you want fame

Are you in the game?

Dans the love game



I'm on a mission and it involves some heavy touching, yeah

You've indicated your interest, I'm educated in sex, yes

and now I want it bad, want it bad

A love game, A love game



Hold me and love me

Just want touch you for a minute

Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it



Let's have some fun, this beat is sick

I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Don't think too much, just bust that kick

I wanna take a ride on your disco stick



Let's play a love game, play a love game

Do you want love, or you want fame

are you in the game?

Dans the love game

Let's play a love game, play a love game

Do you want love, or you want fame

Are you in the game?

Dans the love game



I can see you staring there from across the block

with a smile on your mouth and your hand on your (huh!)

The story of us, it always starts the same

A boy and a girl and a (huh!) and a game (and a game, and a game .. doo doooooo)



Let's play a love game, play a love game

Do you want love, or you want fame

are you in the game?

Dans the love game

Let's play a love game, play a love game

Do you want love, or you want fame

Are you in the game?

Dans the love game



Let's play a love game, play a love game

Do you want love, or you want fame

are you in the game?

Dans the love game

Let's play a love game, play a love game

Do you want love, or you want fame

Are you in the game?

Dans the love game
