In the night I hear him talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless (heartless)
How could you be so heartless Oh
How could you be so heartless



How you be so cold

As the winter wind when it breeze yo

Just remember that you talkin to me yo

You need to watch the way you talkin to me yo

I mean after all the things that we been thru

I mean after all the things we got into

Ayo I know it's some things that you ain't told me

Ayo I did some things but that's the old me

And now you wanna get me back and you gon show me

So you walkin round like you don't know me

You gotta a new friend, well I got homies

But in the end it's still so lonely



In the night I hear him talk

The coldest story ever told

Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul

To a woman so heartless (heartless)

How could you be so heartless? Oh

How could you be so heartless



How could you be so doctor evil

You bringin out a side of me that I don't know

I decided we wasn't gon speak so

Why we up 3 AM on the phone

Why do she be so mad at me fo

Homie I don't know

Shes hot and cold

I won't stop won't mess my groove up

Cause I already know how this thang go

Ya wanna tell ya friends that ya leavin me

They say that they don't see what ya see in me

You wait a couple months then you gon see

You'll never find nobody better than me



In the night I hear him talk

The coldest story ever told

Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul

To a woman so heartless (heartless)

How could you be so heartless? Oh

How could you be so heartless



Talk and Talk and Talk and Talk

Baby let's just knock it off

They don't know what we been thru

They don't know bout me and you

So I got somethin new to see

And you just gon keep hatin me

And we just gon be enemies

I know you can't believe

I could just leave it wrong

And you can't make it right

I'm gon take off tonight into the night



In the night I hear him talk

The coldest story ever told

Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul

To a woman so heartless (heartless)

How could you be so heartless? Oh

How could you be so heartless
