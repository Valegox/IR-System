What a night for a dance,
you know, i'm a dancing machine
put the fire in my bones
with the sweet taste of kerosene
i get lost in the lights(?),

so high, i don't want to come down

to face the loss of the good thing that i found



woo hoo hoo

woo hoo hoo



in the dark of the night

i can hear you calling my name

with the hardest of hearts

i still feel full of pain



so i drink and i smoke

and i ask

if you're ever around

even though it was me

who drove us right in the ground



see, the time we shared

it was precious to me

all the while i was dreaming of revelry



on a run, baby, run

like a steam down a mountainside

with the wind in my back

i don't ever even bat an eye

just know it was you all along

who had a hole in my heart

but the demon in me 

was the best of friends from the start



so the time we shared

it was precious to me

all a while i was dreaming of revelry

dreaming of revelry



and i told myself

for the way you go

it rained so hard

it felt like snow

everything came

a' tumbling down on me

in the back of the woods

in dark of the night

careless, --(?), your moonlight

everything just felt so empty

dreaming of revelry
