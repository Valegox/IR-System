Ay yo, trophy wife, out you won me
Until you had to find out it's one me
Now you benched, aww, your bum knee

Now I'm the bad guy, call me Chun-Li (ooh)

'Cause you was slippin', yep, you clumsy

And everything I peep, can't just unsee

Sips tea, and it's unsweet

Respect bad gyal when mi done speak

Now we shooting the shot like drive-by

Why you had to make me go call up my side guy?

Can't let a f-boy eff up my nice vibes

Yo Ariana, come let me give you a high five

What did she say? What did he say?

You don't listen 'cause you know everything

You don't even need dreams

Tellin' everybody, "Stay woke, don't sleep"



Ah, gonna break that shit down

You don't wait until they wait another round

Ah, guess you're way above it now

And that's your way to love it now



I've been into you, shit that you've been through

They are so confused, who cares about the rational?

If it ain't your view

That's the bottom line

Know-it-all (know-it-all)

Give you a box of chances, every time you blow it all (blow it all)

As if it were shade, you would just throw it all (throw it all)

It's like you're trying not to glow at all (glow at all)

Know-it-all (know-it-all)

Why do we have chemistry?

With a need for speed

Doin' things that trouble clings to

And binds off our wings
