Single book of matches, it's gonna burn what's standing in the way 
Roaring down the mountain, better call on the fire brigade 
Bury all the pictures and tell the kids that I'm ok 
Even if I'm forgotten you'll remember me for a day 
I, I won't never be your cornerstone, I 



All the black inside me is slowly seeping from the bone 

Everything I cherished is slowly dying or is gone 

Little shaking babies and drunkards seem to all agree 

Once the show gets started its bound to be a sight to see 



I, I won't ever be your cornerstone 

I, I don't wanna be holding on 

I, I won't ever be your cornerstone, I 

Watch her run, can you feel it? (4x) 

I, I won't ever be your cornerstone 

I, I don't wanna be holding on 

I, I won't ever be your cornerstone 

I, I don't wanna be holding on, I
