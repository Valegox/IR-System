How can I decide what's right? 
When you're clouding up my mind 
Can't win your losing fight 
all the time 

Not gonna ever own what's mine 

When you're always taking sides 

You won't take away my pride 

No, not this time 

Not this time 



How did we get here? 

when I use to know you so well 

How did we get here? 

Well, I think I know 



The truth is hiding in your eyes 

And it's hanging on your tongue 

Just boiling in my blood, 

But you think that I can't see 



What kind of man that you are 

If you're a man at all 

Well, I will figure this one out 

on my own 

I'm screaming "I love you so..." 



on my own 

But my thoughts you can't decode



How did we get here? 

when I use to know you so well 

How did we get here? 

Well, I think I know 



Do you see what we've done? 

We're gonna make such fools of ourselves 

Do you see what we've done? 

We're gonna make such fools of ourselves 



How did we get here? 

when I use to know you so well 

How did we get here? 

Well, I think I know 



I think I know 

I think I know 

There is something I see in you 

It might kill me I want it to be true
