Tell me something I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I'll take the pleasure, take it with the pain
And if in the moment I bite my lip
Baby in that moment you know this is

Something bigger than us and beyond bliss

Give me a reason to believe it



Cause if you want to keep me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder

And if you really need me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder

(Baby love me harder)

Ooo love me, love me, love me

Ooo harder, harder, harder



I know your motives

And you know mine

The ones that love me

I tend to leave behind

If you know about me

And choose to stay

Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain

And if in the moment you bite your lip

When I get you moaning you'll know it's real

Can you feel the pressure between your hips

I'll make you feel like the first time





Cause if you want to keep me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder

(Imma love ya harder)

And if you really need me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder

(Love me harder)

Ooo love me, love me, love me

Ooo harder, harder, harder

Ooo love me, love me, love me

Ooo harder, harder, harder

(Love me harder)



So what do I do if I can't figure it out

You got to try, try, try again

So what do I do if I can't figure it out

I'm gonna leave, leave, leave again



Cause it you want to keep me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder

(I will love, love, love)

And if you really need me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, got to, got to love me harder

(Love, love baby)

Cause if you want to keep me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder

(Love me harder)

And if you really need me

You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder

(I'm gonna do it, do it. Imma love ya harder)

Ooo love me, love me, love me (Love you)

Ooo harder, harder, harder (Love me, love me baby)

Ooo love me, love me, love me (Just a little bit harder, harder baby)

Ooo harder, harder, harder
