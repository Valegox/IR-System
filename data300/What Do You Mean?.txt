What do you mean? Oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go

What do you mean? 

Oh what do you mean?

Said you're running out of time

What do you mean? 

Oh what do you mean?

Better make up your mind, what do you mean?



You're so indecisive of what I'm saying

Trying to catch the beat, make up your heart

Don't know if you're happy or complaining

Don't want for us to end, where do I start?



First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right

Wanna argue all day, make love all night

First you're up then you're down and then between

Oh I really wanna know



What do you mean? Oh

When you nod your head yes

But you wanna say no

What do you mean? Hey

When you don't want me to move

But you tell me to go

What do you mean? 

Oh what do you mean?

Said you're running out of time

What do you mean? 

Oh what do you mean?

Better make up your mind, what do you mean?



You're overprotective when I'm leaving

Trying to compromise but I can't win

You wanna make a point but you keep preaching

You had me from the start, won't let this end



First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right

Wanna argue all day, make love all night

First you're up then you're down and then between

Oh I really wanna know



What do you mean? Oh

When you nod your head yes

But you wanna say no

What do you mean? Hey

When you don't want me to move

But you tell me to go



What do you mean? (I wanna know...)

Oh what do you mean?

Said you're running out of time

What do you mean? (Oh baby...)

Oh what do you mean?

Better make up your mind, what do you mean? Oh

When you nod your head yes

But you wanna say no

What do you mean? Hey

When you don't want me to move

But you tell me to go

What do you mean? 

Oh what do you mean?

Said you're running out of time

What do you mean? 

Oh what do you mean?

Better make up your mind, what do you mean?
