Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself) Take a look in the mirror 
And cry (and cry) Lord what you're doing to me? 

I have spent all my years in believing you

But I just can't get no relief, Lord!



Somebody (somebody) ooh somebody (somebody)

Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Yeah



I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life

I work till I ache in my bones

At the end (at the end of the day)

I take home my hard earned pay all on my own

I get down (down) on my knees (knees)

And I start to pray (praise the Lord)

Till the tears run down from my eyes

Lord somebody (somebody), ooh somebody

(Please) Can anybody find me somebody to love?



(He works hard)

Everyday (everyday) - I try and I try and I try

But everybody wants to put me down

They say I'm going crazy

They say I got a lot of water in my brain

Ah, got no common sense

(He's got) Got nobody left to believe



Ooh somebody

Ooh (somebody)

Anybody find me somebody to love!

(Anybody find me someone to love!)



Got no feel, I got no rhythm

I just keep losing my beat (just keep losing and losing)

I'm okay, I'm alright (he's alright, he's alright)

I ain't gonna face no defeat (yeah, yeah)

I just gotta get out of this prison cell

One day I'm gonna be free, Lord
