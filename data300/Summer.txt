When I met you in the summer
Took my heart a beat sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown
And we could be together baby
Long the skies are blue

You act so innocent now

But you lied so soon

When I met you in the summer



When I met you in the summer

Took my heart a beat sound

We fell in love

As the leaves turned brown

And we could be together baby

Long the skies are blue

You act so innocent now

But you lied so soon

When I met you in the summer

SummerÂ…

When I met you in the summer

Summer...
