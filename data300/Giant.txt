I understood loneliness
Before I knew what it was
I saw the pills on the table
For your unrequited love
I would be nothing
Without you holding me up

Now strong enough for both of us

Both of us, both of us, both of us



I am a giant (Ooh)

Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see

'Cause I am a giant (Ooh)

We'll be breaking boulders, underneath our feet

I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Oh)

I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Oh)



Don't hide your emotions

You can throw down your guard

And freed from the notion

We can be who we are

You taught me something, yeah

That freedom is ours

It was you who taught me living is

Togetherness, togetherness, togetherness



I am a giant (Ooh)

Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see

'Cause I am a giant (Ooh)

We'll be breaking boulders, underneath our feet

I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Oh)

I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Oh)



Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh, oh, oh, oh, hey-oh

Gonna shake, all the way, in the dirt, underneath, yeah, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh, oh, oh, oh, hey-oh

Gonna shake, all the way, in the dirt, underneath, yeah, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh, oh, oh, oh, hey-oh

Gonna shake, all the way, in the dirt, underneath, yeah, yeah

Gonna shake, all the way, in the dirt, underneath, yeah, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh, oh, oh, oh, hey-oh

Gonna shake, all the way, in the dirt, underneath, yeah, yeah

Gonna shake, all the way, in the dirt, underneath



(Ooh)

I am, I am, I am (Ooh)

I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Ooh)

I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Ooh)
