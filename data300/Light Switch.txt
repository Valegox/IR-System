Why you callin' at 11:30
When you only wanna do me dirty? (Uh-uh, uh-uh)
But I hit right back
'Cause you got that-that, yeah

Why you always wanna act like lovers?

But you never wanna be each others' (Uh-uh, uh-uh)

I say don't look back

But I go right back, yeah



All of a sudden, I'm hypnotized

You're the one that I can't deny

Every time that I say I'm gonna walk away

When you're leaving then you leave me stressin' (Me stressin')

Why you always wanna act like lovers?

But you never wanna be each others' (Uh-uh, uh-uh) (Uh-uh)
