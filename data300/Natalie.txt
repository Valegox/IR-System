Oh I never done this before
Never wanna do this again
Long turn on a dusty road
I did it too much so I can't pretend
Well I learned just a little too late
Good God I must've been blind

'Cause she got me for everything, everything, everything, alright

Like my daddy im a gambling man

Never been afraid of roll the dice

But when I put my bet on her

Little miss snake eyes ruined my life

She better sleep with one eye open 

Better make sure to loock her door 

Cause once I get my hands on her, imma ooohh



Natalie, she ran away with all my money

And she did it for fun

Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny

Well i’m diggin a ditch for this gold digging bitch, 

Watch out she's quick

Look out for pretty little thing named Natalie, 

if you see her tell her im coming She better run



The good lord better bless your soul

Cause I dont know already cursed your name

Dont matter which way you go

Payback's gonna come your way

You'll be begging me, please please please

And now I look at you, and laugh, laugh, laugh

Why is it that cry for me, cry for me, cry for me all night

I spend a lifetime in jail (yeah that's what I do)

I'll be smiling in my cell (yeah thinking bout you)

Cant nobody save you now

So there aint no use in try

Once again my hands on you, imma oooh



Natalie, she ran away with all my money 

And she did it for fun

Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny

Well i’m diggin a dicht for this gold digging bitch 

Watch out she's quick

Look out for pretty little thing named Natalie, 

if you see her tell her im coming She better run



I should've known better

Cause when we were together

She never said forever

Im a fool that played in her game



Natalie, she ran away with all my money 

And she did it for fun

Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny

Well i’m diggin a ditch for this gold digging bitch 

Watch out she's quick

Look out for pretty little thing named Natalie, 

if you see her tell her im coming She better run
