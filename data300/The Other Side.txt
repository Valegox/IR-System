(feat. B.o.B., Cee-Lo)
Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go 'bout your day baby
while I had from the sun



It's better if you don't understand

Cause you wont know what it's like

Til you try



You know I've been waiting on the other side

and you, all you gotta do is cross the line

I could wait a whole life time

but you just gotta decide

You know I

I've been waiting on the other, waiting on the other side



We would live forever

Who could ask for more

You could die if you wanted

But baby what for



It's better if you don't understand

And you won't know what it's like

Til you try



[Chorus]



If they say life's a dream

call this insomnia

Cause this ain't Wonderland

it damn sure ain't Narnia

And once you cross the line

you can't change your mind

Yeah I'm a monster

but I'm no Frankenstein

And quite frankly

I've been feeling insane in between my eyes

I really cant explain what I feel inside

If you knew what I was you's would run and hide

Many have tried to go into the night

cross over the line and come back alive

But that's the price we pay when we living on the other side



[Chorus]



It's better if you don't understand

It's better if you don't understand

It's better if you don't understand

It's better if you don't understand

It's better if you don't understand

It's better if you don't understand
