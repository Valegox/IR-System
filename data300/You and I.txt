It's been a long time since I came around 
Been a long time but I'm back in town 
And this time I'm not leavin' without you 
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me awe 
I'd give anything again to be your babydoll 
This time I'm not leaving without you. 



He said, sit back down where you belong 

In the corner of my bar with your high heels on 

Sit back down on the couch 

Were we made love the first time 

And you said to me 

(There's Somethin'), Somethin', somethin' about this place 

Somethin' 'bout lonely nights 

And my lipstick on your face 

Somethin', somethin' about 

My cool Nebraska guy 

Yeah somethin' about 

Baby you and I 

It's been two years since I let you go 

I couldn't listen to a joke or rock n' roll 

And muscle cars drove a truck 

Right through my heart 

On my birthday you sang me "Heart of Gold" 

With a guitar hummin' and no clothes 

This time I'm not leaving without you.

You you and I, 

You you and I, 

You you and I, 

You and I 

You you and I 

Oh yeah I'd rather die, 

without you and I 



(Come on put your drinks up) 



We gotta whole lotta money, but we still pay rent 

'Cause you can't buy a house in heaven 

There's only three men that ima serve my whole life 

It's my daddy and Nebraska and Jesus Christ. 

There's Somethin'), Somethin', somethin' about the chase 

(6 Whole years) 

I'm a New York woman born to run you down 

Still want my lipstick all over your face 

There's somethin', somethin' about 

Just knowin' when it's right 

So put your drinks for Nebraska 

For Nebraska, Nebraska I love you. 

You and I, 

You you and I 

Baby I'd rather die 

Without you and I. 

You and I, 

You you and I 

Nebraska I'd rather die 

Without you and I. 

It's been a long time since I came around 

Been a long time but I'm back in town 

And this time I'm not leavin' without you
