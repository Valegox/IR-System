Unless you understand it, and find out what to do
Don't think about it, I'll be running with you
If I can't understand it, I'll find another way
Keep moving, keep moving
Keep moving, keep moving

Keep moving, keep moving



Main Avenue

If you coming like that, then it's about time you know

In a new house, in a new place

If you change

Keep moving, keep moving

I could ring the alarm

I won't take you much longer

(Keep moving, keep moving)

Are you breaking my heart?

Thanks for making me stronger

(Keep moving)



So you think you'll find the truth?

If you change

When you're livin' like that, you can spin around town you know

In a new house, in the UK

If you change

Keep moving, keep moving

I could hear the alarm

I won't take you much longer

(Keep moving, keep moving)

Are you breaking my heart?

Thanks for making me stronger



I could live with it, I could live with it, oh

I could live with it, I could live with it, oh

I could live with it, I could live with it, oh

I could live with it, I could live with it, oh



Unless you understand it, then find out what to do

Don't think about it, I'll be running with you

If I can't understand it, I'll find another way

I could live with it, I could live with it, oh



Keep moving, keep moving

Keep moving, keep moving

Keep moving, keep moving

Keep moving, keep moving
