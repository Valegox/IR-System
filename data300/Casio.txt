Casio, playing on my heart just like a Casio
Breaking it apart so you can let it go
Wait another year that's not original or cynical
Alright, let's go now
When all your dreams are gone

And you're still holding on

You waited far too long

Don't say

I know, you know it's over



Play it cool

I just want the keys back to my vehicle

They're just gonna tell you that it wasn't real

And I just wanna tell you this how I feel

I know you feel

I know you feel it too



When all your dreams are gone

And you're still holding on

You waited far too long

Don't say

I know, you know It's over
