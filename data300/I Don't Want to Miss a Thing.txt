I could stay awake just to hear you breathing
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure



Don't wanna close my eyes

I don't wanna fall asleep

'Coz I'd miss you baby

And I don't wanna miss a thing

'Coz even when I dream of you

The sweetest dream would never do

I'd still miss you baby

And I don't wanna miss a thing



Laying close to you

Feeling your heart beating

And I'm wondering what you're dreaming

Wondering if it's me you're seeing

Then I kiss your eyes

And thank God we're together

I just want to stay with you in this moment forever

Forever and ever



Don't wanna close my eyes

I don't wanna fall asleep

'Coz I'd miss you baby

And I don't wanna miss a thing

'Coz even when I dream of you

The sweetest dream would never do

I'd still miss you baby

And I don't wanna miss a thing



I don't wanna miss one smile

I don't wanna miss one kiss

I just wanna be with you

Right here with you just like this

I just wanna hold you close

Feel your heart so close to mine

And just stay here in this moment for all the rest of time

Yeah yeah yeah yeah



Don't wanna close my eyes

I don't wanna fall asleep

'Coz I'd miss you baby

And I don't wanna miss a thing

'Coz even when I dream of you

The sweetest dream would never do

I'd still miss you baby

And I don't wanna miss a thing



Don't wanna close my eyes

I don't wanna fall asleep

'Coz I'd miss you baby

And I don't wanna miss a thing

'Coz even when I dream of you

The sweetest dream would never do

I'd still miss you baby

And I don't wanna miss a thing



Don't wanna close my eyes

I don't wanna fall asleep

And I don't wanna miss a thing
