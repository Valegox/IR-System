If you ever leave me, baby, 
Leave some morphine at my door 
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication 
To realize what we used to have, 
We don't have it anymore. 


There's no religion that could save me 

No matter how long my knees are on the floor 

So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin' 

Will keep you by my side 

And keep you from walkin' out the door. 



Cause there'll be no sunlight 

If I lose you, baby 

There'll be no clear skies 

If I lose you, baby 

Just like the clouds 

My eyes will do the same if you walk away 

Everyday, it'll rain, rain, rain 

Â 

I'll never be your mother's favorite 

Your daddy can't even look me in the eye 

Oooo if I was in their shoes, I'd be doin' the same thing 

Sayin' there goes my little girl 

Walkin' with that troublesome guy 



But they're just afraid of something they can't understand 

Oooo but little darlin' watch me change their minds 

Yea for you I'll try I'll try I'll try I'll try 

I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding 

If that'll make you mine 



Cause there'll be no sunlight 

If I lose you, baby 

There'll be no clear skies 

If I lose you, baby 

Just like the clouds 

My eyes will do the same if you walk away 

Everyday, it will rain, rain, rain 



Oh don't just say, goodbye 

Don't just say, goodbye 

I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding 

If that'll make it right 



Cause there'll be no sunlight 

If I lose you, baby 

And there'll be no clear skies 

If I lose you, baby 

And just like the clouds 

My eyes will do the same if you walk away 

Everyday, it'll rain, rain, rain
