Can you stay up for the weekend?
And blame god for looking too old
Can you find all that you stand for?
Has been replaced with mountains of gold
You can untrain yourself to notice

To feel pain and swallow fear

But can you stay up for the weekend 'til next year



God I can't do this anymore

Oh I'll be laid down on the floor

As many feet walk through the door

I'm not alone



(Instrumental)



If I see a light flashin'

Could this mean that I'm comin' home?

If I see a man waving

Does this mean that I'm not alone?

(x2)



(Instrumental)



If I see a light flashin

Could this mean that I'm comin home?

If I see a man waving

Does this mean that I'm not alone?

(x2)



(Instrumental)
