Today I don't feel like doin' anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
Cause today I swear I'm not doin' anything

I'm gonna kick my feet up and stare at the fan

Turn the tv on throw my hand in my pants

Nobody's gon' tell me I can't

I'll be lounging on the couch just chillin in my snuggie

Click to MTV so they can teach me how to dougie

Cause in my castle I'm the freakin' man

Oooh yes I said it, I said it, I said it cuz I can



Today I don't feel like doin' anything

I just wanna lay in my bed

Don't feel like picking up my phone

So leave a message at the tone

Cause today I swear I'm not doin' anything

Nothing at all

Woohoo woohoo hoo ooh ooh

Nothing at all

Woohoo woohoo hoo ooh ooh



Tomorrow I'll wake up do some p90x

Meet a real nice girl have some really nice sex

And she's gonna scream out this is great

(Oh my god this is great) yeeah

I might mess around and get my college degree

I bet my old man will be so proud of me

But sorry pops you'll just have to wait

Oooh yes I said it, I said it, I said it cuz I can



Today I don't feel like doin' anything

I just wanna lay in my bed

Don't feel like picking up my phone

So leave a message at the tone

Cause today I swear I'm not doin' anything



No I ain't gonna comb my hair

Cause I ain't goin' anywhere

No no no no no no no no no noooooooo

I'll just strut in my birthday suit

And let everything hang loose

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaahhhhh



Ohh today I don't feel like doin' anything

I just wanna lay in my bed

Don't feel like picking up my phone

So leave a message at the tone

Cause today I swear I'm not doin' anything

Nothing at all

Woohoo woohoo hoo ooh ooh

Nothing at all

Woohoo woohoo hoo ooh ooh

Nothing at all
