I took my baby
On a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you
Yes we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles

And a miracle

Has happened tonight



But if you're thinkin'

About my baby

It don't matter if you're

Black or white



They print my message

In the Saturday Sun

I had to tell them

I ain't second to none



And I told about equality

And it's true

Either you're wrong

Or you're right



But if you're thinkin'

About my baby

It don't matter if you're

Black or white



I Am tired Of This Devil

I Am tired Of This Stuff

I Am tired Of This Business

Sew when the

Going gets rough

I ain't scared of your brother

I ain't scared of no sheets

I ain's scared of nobody

Girl when the goin' gets mean



Rap:

Protection

For Gangs, Clubs 

And Nations

Causing Grief In

Human Relations

It's A Turf War

On A Global Scale

I'd Rather Hear Both Sides

Of The Tale

See, It's Not About Races

Just Places

Faces

Where Your Blood

Comes From

Is Where Your Space Is

I've Seen The Bright

Get Duller

I'm Not Going To Spend

My Life Being A Color



Don't Tell Me You Agree With Me 

When I Saw You Kicking Dirt In My Eye



But If You're Thinkin' 

About My Baby

It Don't Matter 

If You're Black Or White



I Said If

You're Thinkin' Of 

Being My Baby 

It Don't Matter 

If You're Black Or White



I Said If

You're Thinkin' Of

Being My Brother

It Don't Matter If You're

Black Or White



Ooh, Ooh

Yea, Yea, Yea Now

Ooh, Ooh

Yea, Yea, Yea Now



It's Black, It's White

It's Tough For You

To Get By

It's Black , It's White, Whoo



It's Black, It's White

It's Tough For You

To Get By

It's Black , It's White, Whoo
