Johnny take a walk with your sister the moon
Let her pale light in to fill up your room
You've been living underground
Eating from a can
You've been running away
From what you don't understand:

Love

She's slippy

You're sliding down

She'll be there when you hit the ground



It's alright, it's alright, alright

She moves in mysterious ways

It's alright, it's alright, alright

She moves in mysterious ways

Ah...ah...ah...



Johnny take a dive with your sister in the rain

Let her talk about the things you can't explain

To touch is to heal

To hurt is to steal

If you wanna kiss the sky

Better learn how to kneel

On your knees boy!



She's the wave

She turns the tide

She sees a man inside the child



It's alright, it's alright, alright

She moves in mysterious ways

It's alright, it's alright, alright

She moves in mysterious ways

It's alright, it's alright, alright

Lift my days, light up my nights



One day you will look back

And you'll see

Where you were held

How? By this love

While you could stand there

You could move on this moment

Follow this feeling



It's alright, it's alright, alright

She moves in mysterious ways

It's alright, it's alright, alright

She moves in mysterious ways

It's alright, it's alright, alright



We move through miracle days

Spirit moves in mysterious ways

She moves with it

She moves with it

Lift my days, light up my nights
