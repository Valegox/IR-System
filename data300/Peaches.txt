I get my peaches out in Georgia, ooh, yeah, shit
I get my weed from California, that's that shit
I took my chick up to the North, yeah, badass bitch
I get my light right from the source, yeah, yeah that’s it
And I see you (Oh), the way I breathe you in (In)

It's the texture of your skin

I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby

Never let you go, oh

And I see you

There's nothing like your touch

It’s the way you lift me up, yeah

And I'll be right here with you 'til the end



I get my peaches out in Georgia, ooh, yeah, shit

I get my weed from California, that's that shit

I took my chick up to the North, yeah, badass bitch

I get my light right from the source, yeah, yeah, that's it



You enjoy it, but I'm for your

All I can want, all I can wish for

Nights alone that we wished for

And days we savin' souvenirs

There's no time, I wanna make more time

And give you my whole life

I left my girl, I’m in my Yorker

Hate to leave, call it torture

Remember when I couldn’t hold her

Left the baggage from her over



I get my peaches out in Georgia, ooh, yeah, shit

I get my weed from California, that's that shit

I took my chick up to the North, yeah, badass bitch

I get my light right from the source, yeah, yeah, that’s it



I get the feeling, so I'm sure (Sure)

Hand in my hand because I'm yours

I can't, I can’t pretend, I can't ignore you're right for me

Don't think you wanna know just where I stand, oh

Girl, you got me distracted

The one I need is right in my arms

If this is the sweetest of mind

And I'll be right here with you 'til end of time



I get my peaches out in Georgia, ooh, yeah, shit

I get my weed from California, that's that shit

I took my chick up to the North, yeah, badass bitch

I get my light right from the source, yeah, yeah, that's it

I get my peaches out in Georgia, ooh, yeah, shit

I get my weed from California, that's that shit

I took my chick up to the North, yeah, badass bitch

I get my light right from the source, yeah, yeah, that's it

I get my peaches out in Georgia, ooh, yeah, shit

I get my weed from California, that's that shit

I took my chick up to the North, yeah, badass bitch

I get my light right from the source, yeah, yeah, that's it

I get my peaches out in Georgia, ooh, yeah, shit

I get my weed from California, that's that shit

I took my chick up to the North, yeah, badass bitch

I get my light right from the source, yeah, yeah, that's it
