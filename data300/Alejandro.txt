I know that we are young, and I know you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro...
She's got both hands in her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you

She hides true love en su bolsillo

She's got a halo around her finger, around you



You know that I love you, boy

Hot, like Mexico rejoice

At this point I've gotta choose nothing to lose



Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro

I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando

Don't want to kiss, don't want to touch

Just smoke my cigarette and hush

Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto

Alejandro, Alejandro

Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

Alejandro, Alejandro

Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro



Stop, please, just let me go

Alejandro, just let me go



She's not broken

She's just a baby

But her boyfriend's like her dad, just like a dad

And all those flames that burned before him

Now he's gotta firefight, gotta cool the bad



You know that I love you, boy

Hot, like Mexico rejoice

At this point I've gotta choose nothing to lose



Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro

I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando

Don't want to kiss, don't want to touch

Just smoke my cigarette and hush

Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto

Alejandro, Alejandro

Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

Alejandro, Alejandro

Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro



Alejandro
