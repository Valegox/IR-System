I let it fall, my heart, 
And as it fell you rose to claim it. 
It was dark and I was over, 
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me. 

My hands, they were strong, 

but my knees were far too weak, 

To stand in your arms without falling to your feet, 



But there's a side to you that I never knew,never knew. 

All the things you'd say, they where never true, never true, 

And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win. 



But I set fire to the rain, 

Watched it pour as I touched your face, 

well it burnt while I cried, 

Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name! 



When I lay with you 

I could stay there, Close my eyes, 

feel you here forever, 

You and me together, nothing is better! 



Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew, 

All the things you'd say they where never true, never true, 

And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win. 



But I set fire to the rain, 

Watched it pour as I touched your face, 

well it burnt while I cried, 

Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name! 

I set fire to the rain 

and I threw us into the flames

well it felt something died

Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time! 



Sometimes I wake up by the door, 

that heart you caught must be waiting for ya. 

Even now when we're already over 

I can't help myself from looking for ya



I set fire to the rain, 

Watched it pour as I touched your face, 

well it burnt when I cried, 

Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name 

I set fire to the rain, 

and i threw us into the flames

Well I felt something died cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time.



Oh, oh no

let it burn



let it burn, let it burn
