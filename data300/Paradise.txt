Ooooh...

When she was just a girl,
She expected the world,
But it flew away from her reach,
So she ran away in her sleep.



And dreamed of para-para-paradise,

Para-para-paradise,

Para-para-paradise,

Every time she closed her eyes.



Ooooh...



When she was just a girl,

She expected the world,

But it flew away from her reach,

And bullets catch in her teeth.



Life goes on,

It gets so heavy,

The wheel breaks the butterfly.

Every tear, a waterfall.

In the night, the stormy night,

She closed her eyes.

In the night, the stormy night,

Away she flied.



And dreamed of para-para-paradise,

Para-para-paradise,

Para-para-paradise,

Whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh.



She dreamed of para-para-paradise,

Para-para-paradise,

Para-para-paradise,

Whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh.



La, la, la...



And so lying underneath those stormy skies

She'd say, "oh, ohohohoh I know the sun must set to rise"



This could be

Para-para-paradise

Para-para-paradise

Para-para-paradise

Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh



This could be

Para-para-paradise

Para-para-paradise

Para-para-paradise

Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh



This could be

Para-para-paradise

Para-para-paradise

Para-para-paradise

Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh



Ooooh...
