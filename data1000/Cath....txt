Cath...
She stands with a well intentioned man.
But she can't relax with his hands on the small of her back.
As the flashbulbs burst she holds a smile.
Like someone would hold a crying child.

Soon everybody will ask what became of you.

Your heart was dying fast and you didn't know what to do.



Cath...

It seems that you live in someone else's dream.

In a hand-me-down wedding dress

With the things that could have been are repressed.

But you said your vows and you closed the door

On so many men who would have loved you more.



Soon everybody will ask what became of you.

Your heart was dying fast and you didn't know what to do.

The whispers that it won't last roll up and down the pews.

And if our hearts were dying that fast, they would have done the same as you.

I'd have done the same as you
