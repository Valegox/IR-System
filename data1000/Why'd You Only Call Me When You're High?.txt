The mirror's image
tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished
Cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived, I thought I saw you leaving

carrying your shoes

decided that once again I was just dreaming

of bumping into you.



Now it's three in the morning

and I'm trying to change your mind

left you multiple missed calls

And to my message, you reply



Why'd you only call me when you're high?

High

High, Why'd you only call me when you're high?



Somewhere darker

talking the same shite

I need a partner

Well, are you out tonight?

It's harder and harder to get you to listen

'more i get through the gears

incapable of making alright decisons

and having bad ideas



Now it's three in the morning

and I'm trying to change your mind

left you multiple missed calls

And to my message you reply

(Message you reply)

Why'd you only call me when you're high?

(Why'd you only call me)



High, Why'd you only call me when you're high?



And I can't see you here, 

wondering where am I?

sorta feels like i'm running out of time

I haven't found what i was hoping to find



You said you gotta be up in the morning

gonna have an early night

then you started to bore me

baby why'd you only call me when you're high?



Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?

Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?

Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?

Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
