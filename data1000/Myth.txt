Drifting in and out, see the road you're on
You came rolling down the cheek
Say just what you need
And in between it's never as it seems
Help me to make it
Help me to make it



If you build yourself a myth

Know just what to give

What comes after this

Momentarily bliss

Consequence of what you do to me



Help me to make it

Help me to make it



Found yourself in a new direction

Eons far from the sun

Can you come when they come to reach you

Let you know you're not the only one



Can't keep hanging on

To all that's dead and gone

If you build yourself a myth

Know just what to give

Do you lies

We'll let the ashes fly



Help me to make it

Help me to make it
