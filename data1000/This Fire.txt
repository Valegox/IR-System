Eyes, boring a way through me
Paralyse, controlling completely
Now there is a fire in me
A fire that burns
This fire is out of control

I'm going to burn this city

Burn this city



This fire is out of control

I'm going to burn it

I'll burn it down



Eyes, burning a way through me

Overwhelm, destroying so sweetly

Now, there is a fire within me

A fire that burns



This fire is out of control

I'm going to burn this city

Burn this city



This fire is out of control

Then I'm out of control

And I burn

Oh, how I burn



This fire is out of control

I'm going to burn this city

Burn this city...
