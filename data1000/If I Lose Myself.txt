I stared up at the sun
Thought of all the people, places and things I've loved
I stand up just to see
Of all the faces,
you are the one next to me


You can feel the light start to tremble

Washing what you know out to sea

You can see your life out of the window, tonight...



If I lose myself tonight

It'll be by your side

If I lose myself tonight...

woooh, woooh, woooh!



If I lose myself tonight

It'll be you and I...

Lose myself tonight



I woke up with the sun

Thought of all the people, places and things I've loved

I woke up just to see

Of all the faces

you are the one next to me



You can feel the light start to tremble

Washing what you know out to sea

You can see your life out of the window, tonight...



If I lose myself tonight

It'll be by your side

If I lose myself tonight...

woooh, woooh, woooh!



If I lose myself tonight

It'll be you and I...

Lose myself tonight

whooooooo...

whooooooo...



Take us down and we keep trying

40 000 feet keep flying...

Take us down and we keep trying

40 000 feet keep flying...

Take us down and we keep trying

40 000 feet keep flying...

Take us down and we keep trying

40 000 feet keep flying...



Lose myself

If I lose myself tonight..

Whoooooooooo

whoooooo,whoooo,
