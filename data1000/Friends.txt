I was wonderin' 'bout your mama 
Did she get that job she wanted? 
Sold that car that gave her problems
I'm just curious 'bout her, honest 


Girl, you wonderin' why I've been callin'? 

Like I've got ulterior motives 

No, we didn't end this so good 

But you know we had something so good 



So I'm wondering, can we still be friends? (oh-oh) 

Can we still be friends? (oh-oh) 

Doesn't have to end 

And if it ends, can we be friends? 

Can we be friends? 

Can we be friends? 



Wonderin' if you got a body 

To hold you tight since I left 

Wonderin' if you think about me 

Actually, don't answer that 



Now you wonderin' why I've been callin'? 

Like I've got ulterior motives 

No, we didn't end this so good 

But you know we had something so good 



So I'm wondering, can we still be friends? (oh-oh) 

Can we still be friends? (oh-oh) 

Doesn't have to end 

And if it ends, can we be friends? 

Can we be friends? 

Can we be friends? 

And if it ends, can we be friends? 



Now you wonderin' why I've been callin'? 

Like I've got ulterior motives 

No, we didn't end this so good 

But you know we had something so good 



I'm wondering, can we still be friends? (oh-oh) 

Can we still be friends? (oh-oh) 

Doesn't have to end 

And if it ends, can we be friends?
