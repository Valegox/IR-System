Look at the stars
look how they shine for you
and everything you do
yeah they were all yellow
I came along 
I wrote a song for you

and all the things you do

and it was called yellow

So then I took my turn 

oh what a thing to have done

and it was all yellow



your skin

oh yeah your skin and bones

turn into something beautiful

and you know

you know I love you so

you know I love you so



I swam across

I jumped across for you

oh what a thing to do

'cos you were all yellow

I drew a line

I drew a line for you

oh what a thing to do

and it was all yellow



and your skin

oh yeah your skin and bones

turn into something beautiful

and you know

for you I bleed myself dry

for you I bleed myself dry



it's true

look how they shine for you

look how they shine for you

look how they shine for

look how they shine for you

look how they shine for you

look how they shine



look at the stars

look how they shine for you

and all the things that you do
