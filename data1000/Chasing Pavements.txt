I've made up my mind,
Don't need to think it over,
If i'm wrong I am right,
Don't need to look no further,
This ain't lust,
I know this is love but,



If i tell the world,

I'll never say enough,

Cause it was not said to you,

And thats exactly what i need to do,

If i end up with you,



Should i give up,

Or should i just keep chasing pavements?

Even if it leads nowhere,

Or would it be a waste?

Even If i knew my place should i leave it there?

Should i give up,

Or should i just keep chasing pavements?

Even if it leads nowhere



I'd build myself up,

And fly around in circles,

Wait then as my heart drops,

and my back begins to tingle

finally could this be it or



Should i give up,

Or should i just keep chasing pavements?

Even if it leads nowhere,

Or would it be a waste?

Even If i knew my place should i leave it there?

Should i give up,

Or should i just keep chasing pavements?

Even if it leads nowhere



Should i give up,

Or should i just keep chasing pavements?

Even if it leads nowhere,

Or would it be a waste?

Even If i knew my place should i leave it there?

Should i give up,

Or should i just keep chasing pavements?

Should i just keep chasing pavements? Oh oh



Should i give up,

Or should i just keep chasing pavements?

Even if it leads nowhere,

Or would it be a waste?

Even If i knew my place should i leave it there?

Should i give up,

Or should i just keep chasing pavements?

Even if it leads nowhere
