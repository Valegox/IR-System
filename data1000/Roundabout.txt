I'll be the round about
the words will make you out 'n' out
you change the day your way
call it morning driving thru the sound and in and out the valley
The music dance and sing

they make the children really ring

I spend the day your way

call it morning driving thru the sound and in and out the valley





In and around the lake

mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

one mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too

twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be there with you



I will remember you

your silhouette will charge the view

of distance atmosphere

call it morning driving thru the sound and even in the valley



Along the drifting cloud the eagle searching down on the land

catching the swirling wind the sailor sees the rim of the land

the eagles dancing wings create as weather spins out of hand

go closer hold the land feel partly no more than grains of sand

we stand to lose all time a thousand answers by in our hand

next *to* your deeper fears we stand

surrounded by a millions years
