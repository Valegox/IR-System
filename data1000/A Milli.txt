[Verse 1:]
A Millionaire,
I'm a Young Money Millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed

Through the pencil and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind,

Cause I don't write shit cause I ain't got time,

Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the all mighty dolla,

And the all mighty power of dat ch-ch-ch-ch-chopper,

Sister, Brother, Son, Daughter, Father motha fuck a copper,

Got tha maserati dancin on the bridge pussy poppin,

Tell the coppers... ha ha ha ha you can't catch em, you can't stop em,

I go by them goon rules,

If you can't beat em, then you pop em,

You can't man em, then you mop em,

You can't stand em, then you drop em,

You pop em cause we pop em like Orville Redenbacher,



[Verse 2:]

A millie in here

With them Young Money Millionaires

Think you wheelie pop a wheelie in air,

Mac Milli... the Vanilli's in here I'm a rascal don't get whopped,

I get brats who don't give top, I get tassel, pass you with a flow you could

Never put a brake on, An I break on anything a nigga take on,

Feel the napalm from my trey arm, straight long, throw a nigga like I'm Akon,

Cause I make cons... Where the base gone, get the base blown,

Let the Pistons on that chopper come on cops I'm kamikaze

Drop a rock with them Obamas, Illie in the mind, really with the nine,

Millie when I rhyme, silly anytime, Fine, chilly gitty on da grind, Shitty on a dime,

Penny on the line, Plentys in me, any guinea's with em bigger than a mini and remind

I'm Illie and it's all off G piece and a P... G walk by beep beep,

With a freak, skeet, Hawk Out, big feet on a jeep...

She caught by Weezy F, we be the best,

Truely to death, prove me the rest,

Groupies confess, you be the ref, excuse me I left... Ha
