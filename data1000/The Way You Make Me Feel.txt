Hee-hee!
Ooh!
Go on girl!
Aaow!

Hey pretty baby with the high heels on

You give me fever

Like I've never, ever known

You're just a product of loveliness

I like the groove of your walk,

Your talk, your dress

I feel your fever

From miles around

I'll pick you up in my car

And we'll paint the town

Just kiss me baby

And tell me twice

That you're the one for me



The way you make me feel

(The way you make me feel)

You really turn me on

(You really turn me on)

You knock me off of my feet

(You knock me off of my feet)

My lonely days are gone

(My lonely days are gone)



I like the feelin' you're givin' me

Just hold me baby and I'm in ecstasy

Oh I'll be workin' from nine to five

To buy you things to keep you by my side

I never felt so in love before

Just promise baby, you'll love me forever more

I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied

'Cause you're the one for me



The way you make me feel

(The way you make me feel)

You really turn me on

(You really turn me on)

You knock me off of my feet now baby - hee!

(You knock me off of my feet)

My lonely days are gone - a acha acha

(My lonely days are gone)

Acha-ooh



Go on girl!

Go on! Hee! Hee! Aaow!

Go on girl!

I never felt so in love before

Promise baby, you'll love me forevermore

I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied

'Cause you're the one for me...



The way you make me feel

(The way you make me feel)

You really turn me on

(You really turn me on)

You knock me off of my feet now baby - hee!

(You knock me off of my feet)

My lonely days are gone - a acha acha

(My lonely days are gone)

Acha-ooh



The way you make me feel

(The way you make me feel)

You really turn me on

(You really turn me on)

You knock me off of my feet now baby - hee!

(You knock me off of my feet)

My lonely days are gone - a acha acha

(My lonely days are gone)

Acha-ooh



The way you make me feel

You really turn me on

You knock me off of my feet now baby

My lonely days are gone 

The way you make me feel

You really turn me on

You knock me off of my feet now baby

My lonely days are gone 

The way you make me feel

You really turn me on

You knock me off of my feet

My lonely days are gone 

The way you make me feel

You really turn me on

You knock me off of my feet

My lonely days are gone
