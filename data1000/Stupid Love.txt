You’re the one that I've been waiting for
Gotta quit this crying, nobody's gonna
Heal me if I don’t open the door
Kinda hard to believe (Gotta have faith in me)
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out (Look at me)

Get down, get down, get down, get down (Look at me)

Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out

Look at me now



'Cause all I ever wanted was love

Hey, hey-uh, (Ooh-ooh), hey, hey-uh, (Ooh-ooh), hey, hey-uh

All I ever wanted was love

Hey, hey-uh, (Ooh-ooh), hey, hey-uh (Ooh-ooh), hey, hey-uh (Higher, higher)



I want your stupid love, love

I want your stupid love, love

(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)



Now it's time to free me from the chain

I gotta find that peace, is it too late

Or could this love protect me from the pain?

I would battle for you (Even if I break in two)



Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out (Look at me)

Get down, get down, get down, get down (Look at me)

Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out

Look at me now



'Cause all I ever wanted was love

Hey, hey-uh, (Ooh-ooh), hey, hey-uh, (Ooh-ooh), hey, hey-uh

All I ever wanted was love

Hey, hey-uh, (Ooh-ooh), hey, hey-uh (Ooh-ooh), hey, hey-uh (Higher, higher)



I want your stupid love, love

I want your stupid love, love

(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)



I don't need a reason (Oh)

Not sorry, I want your stupid love

I don't need a reason (Oh)

Not sorry, I want your stupid love

Higher, higher



I want your stupid love, love (Oh, oh, woo)

We got a stupid love, love (Love, love)

(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

I want your stupid love, love

(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

I want your stupid love, love
