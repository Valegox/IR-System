2nd floor...hardware, children's wear, lady's lingerie
Oh, good morning Mr. Tyler, going down?
Workin' like a dog for the boss man
Workin' for the company
I'm bettin' on the dice I'm tossin'

I'm gonna have a fantasy



But where am I gonna look?

They tell me that love is blind

I really need a girl like an open book

To read between the lines



Love In An Elevator

Livin' it up when I'm goin' down

Love In An Elevator

Lovin' it up till I hit the ground



Jackeys in the elevator

Lingerie second floor

She said 'can I see you later

And love you just a little more?'



I kinda hope we get stuck

Nobody gets out alive

She said 'I'll show you how to fax

In the mailroom, honey

And have you home by five'



Love In An Elevator

Livin' it up when I'm goin' down

Love In An Elevator

Lovin' it up till I hit the ground



Elevator

Going down

Haha-haha-haha-haha!



Love In An Elevator

Livin' it up when I'm goin' down

Love In An Elevator

Lovin' it up till I hit the ground



Gonna be a penthouse pauper

Gonna be a millionaire

Gonna be a real fast talker

And have me a love affair



Gotta get my timing right

It's a test that I got to pass

I'll chase you all the way to the stairway honey

Kiss your sassafrass



Love In An Elevator

Livin' it up when I'm goin' down

Love In An Elevator

Lovin' it up till I hit the ground
