In many ways they'll miss the good old days
Someday, someday
Yeah it hurts to say but I want you to stay
Sometimes, sometimes
When we was young ah man did we have fun
Always, always

Promises they break before they're made

Sometimes, sometimes



Oh my ex says I'm lacking in depth

I will do my best

You say you want to stay by my side

Darling your head's not right

You see alone we stand together we fall apart

Yea I think I'll be all right

I'm working so I wont have to try so hard

Tables they turn sometimes, oh someday

I ain't wasting no more time



Trying, trying



And now my fears they come to me in threes

So I, sometimes

They fade my friend, you say the strangest things

I find, sometimes



Oh my ex says I'm lacking in depth

Say I will try my best

You say you want to stay by my side

Darling your head's not right

You see alone we stand together we fall apart

Ah I think I'll be all right

I'm working so I wont have to try so hard

Tables they turn sometimes, oh someday

I ain't wasting no more time
