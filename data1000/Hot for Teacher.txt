Oh, wow, man, I said
Wait a second, man
What do you think the teacher's gonna look like this year?
Fuck man! 
Uh!

Oh yeah! 



T-T-teacher stop that screamin'

Teacher don't you see?

Don't wanna be no uptown fool

Maybe I should go to hell

But I am doing well

Teacher needs to see me after school 



I think of all the education that I've missed

But then my homework was never quite like this! 



Ow! Got it bad,

Got it bad,

Got it bad,

I'm hot for teacher!

I've got it bad, so bad

I'm hot for teacher! 



Hey, I heard you missed us

We're back! (Hey!)

I brought my pencil

Give me something to write on, man!

Whoa 



Uh! 



Ooo-oo-ooo 



I heard about your lessons

but lessons are so cold

I didn't know about this school

Little girl from Cherry Lawn

How can you be so bold?

How did you know that golden rule? 



I think of all the education that I've missed

But then my homework was never quite like this! 



Whoa! Got it bad,

Got it bad,

Got it bad,

I'm hot for teacher!

I've got it bad, so bad

I'm hot for teacher! 



Whoa!

(Guitar Solo) 



Oh man, I think the clock is slow

(What are you doin' this weekend?) I don't feel tardy

Class dismissed!

Ooh-yeah! 



I've got it bad,

Got it bad,

Got it bad,

I'm hot for teacher! 



Whoa!

Oh! Ooh, yes I'm hot

Wow! 



Oh my God!

Woo!
