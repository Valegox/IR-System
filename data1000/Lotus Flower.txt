I will shake myself into your pocket
Invisible, do what you want, do what you want
I will sink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove and cut me up and cut me up
There's an empty space inside my heart

Where the weeds take root

And now I'll set you free

I'll set you free

There's an empty space inside my heart

Where the weeds take root

Tonight I'll set you free

I'll set you free



Slowly we unfurl

As lotus flowers

Cuz all I want is the moon upon a stake

Just to see what is, just to see what is

I can't kick your habit

Just to feed your fast ballooning head

Listen to your heart



We will shake and be quiet as mice

While the cat is away, do what we want, do what we want



There's an empty space inside my heart

Where the weeds take root

So now I set you free

I set you free



Cuz all I want is a moon upon a stake

Just to see what is, just to see what is

Oh, a bird has flown into my room

Slowly we unfurl

As lotus flowers

Cuz all I want is the moon upon a stake

Or dance around a pit

The darkness is beneath

I can't kick your habit

Just to feed your fast ballooning head

Listen to your heart
