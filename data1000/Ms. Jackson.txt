[Andre 3000]
Yeah this one right here goes out to all the baby's mamas, mamas...
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas, mamas
Yeah, go like this
[CHORUS: Andre 3000]

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH], I am for real

Never meant to make your daughter cry

I apologize a trillion times

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH], I am for real

Never meant to make your daughter cry

I apologize a trillion times



[Big Boi]

My baby's drama mama, don't like me

She be doin things like havin them boys come from her neighborhood 

to the studio tryin to fight me

She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out

That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out

And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck

Private school, daycare, shit medical bills I PAY THAT

I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down

She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down

Shit; you never got a chance 

to hear my side of the story we was divided

She had fish fries and cookouts 

for my child's birthday I ain't invited

Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through

All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah



[Chorus]



[Andre 3000]

Me and yo' daughter.. gots this thang goin on

(We got a special kind of thang goin on)

You say it's puppy love (arf arf arf)

We say it's full grown (ARF ARF WOOF!)

Hope that we feel this.. feel this way forever

You can plan a pretty picnic

but you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson



Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin; fine

The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline

King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream

bout that crib with the Goodyear swing

on the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever

Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?

Forever never seems that long until you're grown

And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too wrong

Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could

become a magician to abacadabra all the sadder

thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he

Askin what happened to the feelin that her and me

Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads

It happened for a reason one can't be, mad

So know this, know that everythang's cool

And yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation



[Chorus]



[Big Boi]

Uh, uh, yeah

"Look at the way he treats me" 

Shit, look at the way you treat me

You see your little nosy-ass homegirls 

done got your ass sent up the creek G

Without a paddle, you left to straddle 

and ride this thing on out

Now you and your girl ain't speakin no more 

cause my dick all in her mouth

Knahm'talkinbout? Jealousy, infidelity, envy

Cheating to beating, envy and to the G they be the same thing

So who you placin the blame on, you keep on singin the same song

Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on

You and your mama



[Chorus] - 2X
