People are people 
So why should it be 
You and I should get along so awfully 
So we're different colours 
And we're different creeds 

And different people have different needs 



It's obvious you hate 

Though I've done nothing wrong 

I've never even met you 

So what could I have done 



I can't understand 

What makes a man 

Hate another 

Help me understand 

Help me understand 



Now you're punching 

And you're kicking 

And you're shouting at me 

I'm relying on your common decency 



So far it hasn't surfaced 

But I'm sure it exists 

It just takes a while to travel 

From your head to your fists
