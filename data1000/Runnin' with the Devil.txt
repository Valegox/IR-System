Yeah, Yeah!
Ah, yeah!
I live my life like there's no tomorrow
and all I've got, I had to steal
Least I don't need to beg or borrow

Yes I'm livin' at a pace that kills 



Oooh, yeah

(Ahh!) Runnin' with the devil (Ahh-hah! Yeah!)

(Woo-hoo-oo!) Runnin' with the devil

I'm gonna tell ya all about it 



I found the simple life ain't so simple

When I jumped out, on that road

I got no love, no love you'd call real

Ain't got nobody, waitin' at home 



(Ah, yeah-ah!)

Runnin' with the devil

(God damn it lady. You know I ain't lyin' to ya)

(I'm only gonna tell you one time-ya!)

Runnin' with the devil

(Yes I am! Yeah!) 



(Guitar Solo)

Woo! 



Woo! 



You know I, I found the simple life

Weren't so simple, no

When I jumped out, on that road

Got no love, no love you'd call real

Got nobody, waitin' at home 



(Ah, yeah!)

Runnin' with the devil

(Hold on. Hold on, I'm runnin'! Ah, yeah!)

Runnin' with the devil

(Uh! Uh! Come on, one more time) 



(Guitar Solo) 



(Ha-yeah!)

Runnin' with the devil

(Oh, yeah! Ya-yeah!)

Runnin' with the devil

(Woo! Woo!)

Runnin' with the devil

(Ah-ha, yeah! Ah-ha, yeah! Ah-hah, yeah!)

Runnin' with the devil (Woo!)
