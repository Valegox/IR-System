Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She needs something to change, need to take off the e-e-edge
So f*ck it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much

But you don't got shit to say-ay-ay (Say)

I want you out of my head

I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)

There's no way I could save you (Save you)

'Cause I need to be saved too

I'm no good at goodbyes



We're both actin' insane, but too stubborn to change

Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins

And my fingertips stained, looking over the e-e-edge

Don't f*ck with me tonight

Say you needed this heart, then you got it (Got it)

Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted (Wanted)

And we wouldn't let go and we lost it

Now I'm a goner



I want you out of my head (Head)

I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)

There's no way I could save you (Save you)

'Cause I need to be saved too (Saved too)

I'm no good at goodbyes



I want you right in my life

I want you back here tonight

I'm tryna cut you, no knife

I wanna slice ya and dice ya

My argue possessive, ain't got you precise

Can you not turn off the TV? I'm watchin' a fight

My flight a garage, blue diamond, no shock

You poppin' like dove, this nigga bein' honest

You don't need a key to drive, your car on a charger

I just wanna see the side, the one that's unbothered, yeah

And I don't watch ya never to go outside ('Side)

I promise if they play, my n*ggas slidin' (Slidin')

I'm f*ckin' in her too but still ridin' (Ride in)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah



I want you out of my head (Head)

I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)

There's no way I could save you (Save you)

'Cause I need to be saved too (Saved too)

I'm no good at goodbyes



Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

I'm no good at goodbyes

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

I'm no good at goodbyes
