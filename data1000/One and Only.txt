You've been on my mind
I grow fonder every day loose myself in time
Just thinking of your face God only knows
Why it's taking me so long to let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want

I don't know why I'm scared, I've been here before

Every feeling every word, I've imagined it all,

You never know if you never tried to forgive your past

And simply be mine



I dare you to let me be all, the one and only

Promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms

So come on and give me the chance

To prove up I'm the one who can

Walk them miles

Until the end starts

If I've been on your mind



You hang on every word I say, lose yourself in time

At the mention of my name, will I ever love

How it feels to hold you close

And have you tell me which ever road I chose you'll go



I don't know why I'm scared, I've been here before

Every feeling every word, I've imagined it all,

You never know if you never tried to forgive your past

And simply be mine



I dare you to let me be all, the one and only

I promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms

So come on and give me the chance

To prove up I'm the one who can

Walk them miles until the end starts



I know it ain't easy

Giving up your heart

I know it ain't easy

Giving up your heart



Nobody's perfect, it ain't easy, trust me I've given up your heart

Nobody's perfect, it ain't easy, trust me I've given up your heart



I know it ain't easy

Giving up your heart

Nobody's perfect, it ain't easy, trust me I've given up your heart



So I dare you to let me be all, the one and only

I promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms

So come on and give me the chance

To prove up I'm the one who can

Walk them miles until the end starts

Come and give me the chance

To prove that I'm the one who can

Walk them miles until the end starts.
