God save the queen
The fascist regime
They made you a moron
Potential H-bomb
God save the queen

She aint no human being

There is no future

In England's dreaming



Don't be told what you want

Don't be told what you need

There's no future no future

No future for you



God save the queen

We mean it man

We love our queen

God saves



God save the queen

'Cos tourists are money

Our figures head

Is not what she seems



Oh god save history

God save your mad parade

Oh lord god have mercy

All crimes are paid



When there's no future

How can there be sin

We're the flowers in the dustbin

We're the poison in your human machine

We're the future you're future



God save the queen

We mean it man

We love our queen

God saves



God save the queen

We mean it man

And there is no future

In England's dreaming



No future no future

No future for you

No future no future

No future for me



No future no future

No future for you

No future no future

No future for you
