Oh lordy,
trouble so hard
oh lordy,
trouble so hard,
don't nobody know my troubles but God 
oh lordy,

trouble so hard

oh lordy,

trouble so hard,

don't nobody know my troubles but God



Went down the hill,

the other day

my soul got happy

and stayed all day



Oh lordy,

trouble so hard

oh lordy,

trouble so hard,

don't nobody know my troubles but God 

oh lordy,

trouble so hard

oh lordy,

trouble so hard,

don't nobody know my troubles but God



went in the room,

didn't stay long,

looked on the bed

and brother was dead



Oh lordy,

trouble so hard

oh lordy,

trouble so hard,

don't nobody know my troubles but God 

oh lordy,

trouble so hard

oh lordy,

trouble so hard,

don't nobody know my troubles but God
