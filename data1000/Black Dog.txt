Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move, gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove.
Oh, oh, child, way you shake that thing, gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting.
Hey, hey, baby, when you walk that way, watch your honey drip, can't keep away.
[Chorus]
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah, ah, ah. Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah, ah, ah.



I gotta roll, can't stand still, got a flame in my heart, can't get my fill.

Eyes that shine burning red, dreams of you all through my head.



Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah.



Hey, baby, oh, baby, pretty baby, Tell me won't you do me now.



Didn't take too long 'fore I found out, what people mean my down and out.

Spent my money, took my car, started telling her friends she wants to be a star.

I don't know but I been told, a big-legged woman ain't got no soul.



[Chorus]



All I ask for when I pray, steady rollin' woman gonna come my way.

Need a woman gonna hold my hand, won't tell me no lies, make me a happy man
