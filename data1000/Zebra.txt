very rough guess - corrections welcome


you know you go
you don't gotta worry now honey
who wastes his child

born so wild



don't i know you better than the rest

all this sent you from, all this sent you from you



you love to stand

in the white sand

didn't ask for mines

i smiled and wined



don't i know you better than the rest

all this sent you from, all this sent you from you



anyway you run, you run before us

black and white horse

arching among us



you love to stand

in the white sand

who wastes his time

born to a man

don't i know you better than the rest

all this sent you from, all this sent you from you



didn't ask for mines

i smiled and wined

who wastes his child
