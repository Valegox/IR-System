Well I'm so above you, 
it is plain to see
But I came to love you anyway
So you pulled my heart out
And I don't mind bleeding
Any old time you keep me waiting, 

waiting, waiting



Oh, oh, oh, oh, 

I got a love that keeps me waiting

Oh, oh, oh, oh, 

I got a love that keeps me waiting

I'm a lonely boy

I'm a lonely boy

Oh, oh, oh, oh, 

I got a love that keeps me waiting



Well your mama kept you 

but your daddy left you

And I should have done you just the same

But I came to love you

Am I born to bleed?

Any old time you keep me waiting, 

waiting, waiting



Oh, oh, oh, oh, 

I got a love that keeps me waiting

Oh, oh, oh, oh, 

I got a love that keeps me waiting

I'm a lonely boy

I'm a lonely boy

Oh, oh, oh, oh, 

I got a love that keeps me waiting



Oh, oh, oh, oh, 

I got a love that keeps me waiting

Oh, oh, oh, oh, 

I got a love that keeps me waiting

I'm a lonely boy

I'm a lonely boy

Oh, oh, oh, oh, 

I got a love that keeps me waiting
