When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling I will be loving you till we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23

And I'm thinking about how



People fall in love in mysterious ways

Maybe just a touch of a hand

Well me I fall in love with you every single day

And I just wanna tell you I am



So honey now, take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud

And maybe we found love right where we are



When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades

And the crowds don't remember my name

When my hands don't play the strings the same way

I know you will still love me the same

Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen

And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory

And I'm thinking about how



People fall in love in mysterious ways

And maybe it's all part of a plan

I'll just keep on making the same mistakes

Hoping that you'll understand



But baby now, take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud

And maybe we found love right where we are



So baby now, take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, oh darling

Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud

That maybe we found love right where we are

And baby we found love right where we are

And we found love right where we are
