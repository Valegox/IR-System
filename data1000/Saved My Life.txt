Boom, boom, boom
Beats my heart, heart, heart
Baby boom, boom, boom
In the dark, dark, dark
Baby boom, boom, boom
Fall apart, part, part

Baby boom, boom, boom

From the start, start, start



But I've been waiting for you

I've been waiting for you

I've been waiting for you

I've been waiting for you

I've been waiting for you

I've been waiting for you

I've been waiting for you

Yeah, I've been waiting for you



Well someone must have sent you here to save my life

Someone must have sent you to save me tonight

I know that in darkness I have found my light

I know that in darkness I've been given sight

In your loving arms I feel delight

In your loving arms I'll be alright

Someone must have sent you to save me tonight

Someone must have sent you here to save my life



Save my life, save my life

Save my life, save my life

Save my life, save my life

Save my life, save my life



High, high, high

We take flight, flight, flight

Baby high, high, high

Touch the sky, sky, sky

Baby high, high, high

Diamond nights, nights, nights

Baby, high, high, high

'Cause love don't lie, lie, lie



I've been waiting for you

I've been waiting for you

I've been waiting for you

I've been waiting for you

I've been waiting for you

I've been waiting for you

I've been waiting for you

I've been waiting for you



Well someone must have sent you here to save my life

Someone must have sent you to save me tonight

I know that in darkness I have found my light

I know that in darkness I've been given sight

In your loving arms I feel delight

In your loving arms I'll be alright

Someone must have sent you to save me tonight

Someone must have sent you here to save my life



Save my life, save my life

Save my life, save my life

Save my life, save my life

Save my life, save my life



Save my life, save my life

Save my life (Someone must have sent you here to...)

Save my life, save my life

Save my life, save my life

You saved my life
