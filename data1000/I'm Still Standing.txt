You could never know what it's likeyour blood like winter freezes just like iceand there's a cold lonely light that shines from youyou'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you useAnd did you think this fool could never winwell look at me I'm coming back againI got a taste of love in a simple wayand if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade awayDon't you know I'm still standing better than I ever didlooking like a true survivor feeling like a little kidand I'm still standing after all this timepicking up the pieces of my life without you on my mindI'm still standing (yea yea yea)I'm still standing (yea yea yea)Once I never could hope to winyou starting down the road laving me againthe threats you made were meant to cut me downand if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by nowY'know I'm still standing better than I ever didAlle looking like a true survivor feeling like a little kidand I'm still standing after all this timeElton picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mindJohn I'm still standing (yea yea yea) I'm still standing (yea yea yea)Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever didStill looking like a true survivor feeling like a little kid and I'm still standing after all this timeStanding picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mindI'm still standing (yea yea yea) I'm still standing (yea yea yea)I'm still standing (yea yea yea) I'm still standing (yea yea yea)I'm still standing (yea yea yea) I'm still standing (yea yea yea)
