...From me, drink from me (oh-ah-oh-ah)
Then we shoot across the sky
Symphony (So high, so high)
Then we shoot across the sky
Oh, angel sent from up above

You know you make my world light up

When I was down, when I was hurt

You came to lift me up

Life is a drink, and love's a drug

Oh now I think I must be miles up

When I was a river dried up

You came to rain a flood



And said drink from me, drink from me

When I was so thirsty

Pour on a symphony

Now I just can't get enough

Put your wings on me, wings on me

When I was so heavy

Pour on a symphony

When I'm low, low, low, low



Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah

Got me feeling drunk and high

So high, so high

Oh-ah-oh-ah-oh-ah

Now I'm feeling drunk and high

So high, so high, woo

(Woo-ooo-ooo-woo)



Oh, angel sent from up above

I feel you coursing through my blood

Life is a drink and your love's about

To make the stars come out



Put your wings on me, wings on me

When I was so heavy

Pour on a symphony

When I'm low, low, low, low



Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah

Got me feeling drunk and high

So high, so high

Oh-ah-oh-ah-oh-ah

I'm feeling drunk and high

So high, so high



Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah

La, la, la, la, la, la, la

So high, so high

Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah

I'm feeling drunk and high

So high, so high



Then we shoot across the sky

Then we shoot across the

Then we shoot across the sky

Then we shoot across the 

Then we shoot across the sky

Then we shoot across the 

Then we shoot across the sky

Then we shoot across the
