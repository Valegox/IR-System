[Chorus]
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy; I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean

(So fresh and so clean clean)

I love when you stare at me; I'm just so fresh, so clean

(So fresh and so clean clean)



[Big Boi]

Sir Luscious gots gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlo's

and El Dorados; I'm wakin up out of my slumber feeling like Rollo

So follow, it's Showtime at the Apollo minus the Kiki Shepards

What about a ho in a leopard-print?

Teddy Pender-grass cooler than Freddie Jackson

sippin a milkshake in a snowstorm

Left her throat warm in the dorm room at the A.U.

We blew hay too, ath-letes might cake you

but you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make

Cause



[Chorus]



[Big Boi]

Canary yellow seven-nine Seville is on display

My nigga - Bongo hooked it up, Omar gon' - dip my rims today

So a nigga can - ride out to the Honeycomb - Hideout

I'ma show you how to - wild out like Jack Tripper

Let me be bambino on your snipples

YKK on yo' zipper, lick you like a - lizard when I'm slizzard

or sober; six million ways to fold ya

Like Noah's, I get two's of youse and you get pretty 'D'

But I'll call yo' ass round eight-ish I know you'll be there for me

Girl



[Chorus]



[Andre 3000]

Those huge baby eyes, get to runnin off at they mouth

and tellin me everything that's on yo' nasty mind

They say you're malnutritioned in need of vitamin D

and invitin me to that tingle in your spine

I love who you are, love who you ain't; you're so Anne Frank

Let's hit the attic to hide out for bout two weeks

Rick James'n, no chains and whips

I do suck lips 'til hips jerk

in double time the boy next do's a freak, ha ha!



[Chorus]



[Hook: Andre 3000]

(And we are...)

The coolest motherfunkers on the planet

(And my my...)

The sky is fallin ain't no need to panic

(But ooh ooh...)

I got a stick and want yo' automatic

(Ooh ooh ooh...)

Compatible created in the attic



[repeat Hook]



[Chorus] - repeat to fade
