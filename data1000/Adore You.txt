Walk in your rainbow paradise (Paradise)
Strawberry lipstick state of mind (State of mind)
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?
You don't have to say you love me

You don't have to say nothing

You don't have to say you're mine



Honey, ahh

I'd walk through fire for you

Just let me adore you

Oh, honey, ahh

I'd walk through fire for you

Just let me adore you

Like it's the only thing I'll ever do

Like it's the only thing I'll ever do



Your wonder under summer sky

Brown skin and lemon over ice

Would you believe it?



You don't have to say you love me

I just wanna tell you somethin'

Lately you've been on my mind



Honey, ahh

I'd walk through fire for you

Just let me adore you

Oh, honey, ahh

I'd walk through fire for you

Just let me adore you

Like it's the only thing I'll ever do

Like it's the only thing I'll ever do



It's the only thing I'll ever do

It's the only thing I'll ever do

It's the only thing I'll ever do

It's the only thing I'll ever do

It's the only thing I'll ever do

It's the only thing I'll ever do

It's the only thing I'll ever do

It's the only thing I'll ever do



I'd walk through fire for you

Just let me adore you

Oh, honey, ahh

I'd walk through fire for you

Just let me adore you

Like it's the only thing I'll ever do, ahh

(It's the only thing I'll ever do, It's the only thing I'll ever do)

I'd walk through fire for you (It's the only thing I'll ever do)

Just let me adore you

Oh, honey, oh, honey, ahh

(It's the only thing I'll ever do, It's the only thing I'll ever do)

I'd walk through fire for you (It's the only thing I'll ever do)

Just let me adore you (It's the only thing I'll ever do)



Ooh, ooh

Oh, honey

Ooh, ooh

Just let me adore you

Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
