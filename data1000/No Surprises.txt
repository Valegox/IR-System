A heart that's full up like a landfill, 
a job that slowly kills you, 
bruises that won't heal
You look so tired and unhappy
bring down the government, 

they don't, they don't speak for us



I'll take a quiet life,

a handshake of carbon monoxide



No alarms and no surprises

no alarms and no surprises

no alarms and no surprises

silent, silent



This is my final fit, my final bellyache with



No alarms and no surprises

no alarms and no surprises

no alarms and no surprises, please



Such a pretty house, such a pretty garden



No alarms and no surprises (let me out of here)

no alarms and no surprises (let me out of here)

no alarms and no surprises, please (let me out of here)
