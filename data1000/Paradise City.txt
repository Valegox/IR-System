Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home



Just an urchin living under the street

I'm a hard case that's tough to beat

I'm your charity case

So buy me something to eat

I'll pay you at another time

Take it to the end of the line



Rags to riches

Or so they say

You gotta keep pushing

For the fortune and fame

You know it's, it's all a gamble

When it's just a game

You treat it like a capitol crime:

Everybody doing their time



Take me down to the Paradise City

Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty

Oh, won't you please take me home

Take me down to the Paradise City

Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty

Oh, won't you please take me home



Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber 

Why I'm here I can't quite remember 

The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe 

I'd have another cigarette but I can't see 

Tell me who you're gonna believe 



Take me down to the Paradise City

Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty

Oh, won't you please take me home

Take me down to the Paradise City

Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty

Oh, won't you please take me home



So far away 

So far away 

So far away 

So far away 



Captain America's been torn apart

Now he's a court jester

With a broken heart

He said: turn me around

And take me back to the start

I must be losing my mind

Are you blind?

I've seen it all a million times



Take me down to the paradise city

Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty

Take me home, yeah yeah

Take me down to the paradise city

Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty

Oh won't you please take me home

Take me down to the paradise city

Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty

Take me home, yeah yeah

Take me down to the paradise city

Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty

Oh won't you please take me home



I wanna go, I wanna go

Oh won't you please take me home

I wanna see how good it can be

Oh won't you please take me home

Take me down to the paradise city

Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty

Take me home

Take me down to the paradise city

Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty

Oh won't you please take me home

Take me down, lead me 'round

Oh won't you please take me home



I wanna see, what a woman can be

I want to take you home

Take me down to the paradise city

Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty

Oh won't you please take me home

I wanna go, I wanna know

Oh won't you please take me home
