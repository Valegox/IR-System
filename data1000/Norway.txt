We were sleeping till 
You came along
With your tiny heart
You let us in the wooden house
To share in all the wealth


Don't you know it's true?

Norway-ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay



Seven figures leap the hungry maws

The beast, he comes to you

He's a hunter for a lonely heart

In the season of the sun



Don't you know it's true?

Norway-ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay



Where you thinkin' that you gotta run to now

With the beating of a tiny heart?

Hang on to the things that you're supposed to say

Billions of stars that open to your fate



Norway-ay-ay-ay, Norway-ay-ay-ay...
