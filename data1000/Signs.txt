Two ravens in the old oak tree, one for you and one for me 
Bluebells in the late December, I see signs now all the time 
The last time we slept together, there was something that was not there 
You never wanted to alarm me but I'm the one that's drowning now 
I could sleep forever these days because in my dreams I see you again 

But this time fleshed out fuller face in your confirmation dress 

It was so like you to visit me to let me know you were ok 

It was so like you visit me, always worrying about someone else 



At your funeral I was so upset, so upset, 

in your life you were larger than this 

statuesque 



I see signs now all the time that your not dead your sleeping 

I believe in anything that brings you back home to me
