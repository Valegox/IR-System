Tender is the night
lying by your side.
Tender is the touch
of someone that you love to much.
Tender is the day
the demons go away.

Lord, I need to find

someone who can heal my mind.



Come on, come on, come on

get through it.

Come on, come on, come on

love's the greatest thing.

Come on, come on, come on

get through it.

Come on, come on, come on

love's the greatest thing, that we have,

I'm waiting for that feeling,waiting for that feeling,

waiting for that feeling to come...

Oh my baby, oh my baby

oh why, oh my 

oh why, oh my 



Tender is the ghost

The ghost I love the most.

Hiding from the sun

waiting for the night to come.

Tender is my heart

it's screwing up my life.

Lord, I need to find

someone who can heal my mind...



Come on, come on, come on

get through it.

Come on, come on, come on

love's the greatest thing.

Come on, come on, come on

get through it.

Come on, come on, come on

love's the greatest thing, that we have,

I'm waiting for that feeling,waiting for that feeling,

waiting for that feeling to come...

Oh my baby, oh my baby

oh why, oh my 

oh why, oh my 



Tender is the night

lying by your side.

Tender is the touch

of someone that you love to much.

Tender is my heart

it's screwing up my life.

Lord, I need to find

someone who can heal my mind...

Chorus

Oh my baby, oh my baby

Heal me, heal me
