Desperado why don't you come to your senses?
You been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh you're a hard one 
But I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you 
Can hurt you somehow



Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy

She'll beat you if she's able

You know the queen of hearts

Is always your best bet



Now it seems to me some fine things

Have been laid upon your table

But you only want the ones

That you can't get



Desperado oh you ain't getting' no younger

Your pain and your hunger

They're drivin' you home

And freedom oh freedom

Well that's just some people talkin'

Your prison is walkin' through

This world all alone



Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime?

The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine

It's hard to tell the nighttime from the day

You're losin' all your highs and lows

Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away?



Desperado why don't you come to your senses

Come down from your fences open the gate

It may be rainin' but there's a rainbow above you

You better let somebody love you

You better love somebody love you

Before it's too late
