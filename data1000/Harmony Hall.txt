We took a vow in summertime
Now we find ourselves in late December
I believe that New Year's Eve
Will be the perfect time
For their great surrender
But they don't remember



Anger wants a voice

Voices wanna sing

Singers harmonize

Till they can't hear anything

Thought that I was free

From all that questioning

But every time a problem ends

Another one begins



And the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness

Anybody with a holy mind can never forgive the sight

Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified

I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die



Within the halls of power lies

A nervous heart that beats

Like a young pretender's

Beneath these velvet gloves I hide

The shameful crooked ends

Of money lender

'Cause I still remember



Anger wants a voice

Voices wanna sing

Singers harmonize

Till they can't hear anything

Thought that I was free

From all that questioning

But every time a problem ends

Another one begins



And the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness

Anybody with a holy mind can never forgive the sight

Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified

I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die



And the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness

Anybody with a holy mind can never forgive the sight

Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified

I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die



I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

And the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness

Anybody with a holy mind can never forgive the sight

Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified

I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die
