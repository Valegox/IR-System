Oh oh, yeah

I've had a little bit too much

All of the people star to rush (start to rush by)

A dizzy twister dance

Can't find my drink or man

Where are my keys?

I lost my phone



What's goin' on, on the floor?

I love this record baby but I can't see straight anymore keep it cool

What's the name of this club?

I can't remember but it's alright, a-alright



JUST DANCE!

Gonna be ok

Da da doo doot-n

JUST DANCE!

Wish I could shut my playboy mouth

How'd I turn my shirt inside out (inside out right)

Control your poison babe

Roses have thorns they say

And we're all gettin' hosed tonight!

Can't believe my eyes so many women without a flaw

And I ain't gonna give it up, steady trying to pick it up like a call

I'm a hit it up beat it up latch on to it until tomorrow yeah



Shorty I can see that you got so much energy\\

The way you twirlin' up them hips round and round

And there is no reason at all why you can't leave here with me

In the meantime stay let me watch you break it down and
