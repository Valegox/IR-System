It?s tearin? up my heart, when I?m with youBut when we are apart, I feel it tooAnd no matter what I do, I feel the painWith or without youBaby I don?t understandJust why we can?t be loversThings are gettin? out of handTryin? to much, but baby we can winLet it goIf you want me girl, let me knowI am down on my kneesI can?t take it anymoreChorusBaby don?t misunderstandWhat I?m tryin? to tell yaIn the corner of my mindBaby, it feels like we?re running out of timeLet it goIf you want me girl, let me knowI am down on my kneesI can?t take it anymoreChorusTearin? up my heart and soulWe?re apart I feel it tooAnd no matter what I do, I feel the painWith or without you(2x)ChorusAnd no matter what I do, I feel the painWith or without you
