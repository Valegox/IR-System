You shout it out,
But I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud not saying much
I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet
You shot me down, but I get up

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose

Fire away, fire away

Ricochet, you take your aim

Fire away, fire away

You shot me down but I won't fall

I am titanium

You shot me down but I won't fall

I am titanium



Cut me down

But it's you who'll have further to fall

Ghost town and haunted love

Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones

I'm talking loud not saying much



I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose

Fire away, fire away

Ricochet, you take your aim

Fire away, fire away

You shot me down but I won't fall

I am titanium

You shot me down but I won't fall

I am titanium

I am titanium

I am titanium



Stone-hard, machine gun

Firing at the ones who run

Stone-hard as bulletproof glass



You shot me down but I won't fall

I am titanium

You shot me down but I won't fall

I am titanium

You shot me down but I won't fall

I am titanium

You shot me down but I won't fall

I am titanium

I am titanium
