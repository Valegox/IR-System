It's always the same,
Always ashamed story
Tell me when i can come in,
To a hopeless troglodyte
But one more time
My answer stands

I swear i mean "no offense"

But you better learn to read,

It's all about membership



Hey, for young and old

Ugly girls and boys

I put you on my list

And make you clap to this

But man, i just need a trip

Just only one can win

And soon you're saying different 



refrain : ( x2 )



DVNO

Four capital letters

Printed in gold

'Cause details make the girls sweat

Even more

While they're shaking their belt 

No need to ask my name 

To figure out how cool I am



Can anyone read, anyone feel 

That I'm losing my patience 

I just came here to bounce 

Ladies are all waxed 

They all know I'm coming 

I'm losing my patience 

I just came here to bounce 



refrain (x2)

That I'm losing my patience

Ladies are all waxed 

They all know I'm coming
