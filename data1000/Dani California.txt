Getting born in the state of Mississippi
Poppa was a Copper and Momma was a Hippy
In Alabama she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the Panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the World does your Company take me for?



Black bandana, sweet Louisiana

Robbin' a bank in the state of Indiana

She's a runner, rebel and a stunner

On her merry way sayin' baby watcha gonna

Looking down the barrel of a hot metal 45

Just another way to survive



California Rest In Peace

Simultaneous Release

California Show Your Teeth

She's my Priestess, I'm your Priest



She's a lover, baby and a fighter

Should have seen it coming when I got a little brighter

With a name like Dani California

Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya

A little older she was still in another breath

I love my baby to death



California Rest In Peace

Simultaneous Release

California Show Your Teeth

She's my Priestess, I'm your Priest



Who knew the other side of you

Who knew what others died to prove

Too true to say goodbye to you

Too true to say, say, say...



Push the fader, gifted animator

One for the now and eleven for the later

Never made it up to Minnesota

North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota

Down in the badlands she was savin' the best for last

It only hurts when I laugh, gone too fast
