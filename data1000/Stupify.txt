Yeah, bringing you another disturbing creation
from the mind of one sick animal who can't tell the difference
and gets stupified 
I've been waiting my whole life for just one FUCK!
And all I needed was just one FUCK!

How can you say that you don't give a FUCK!

I find myself stupified, coming back again

All I wanted was just one FUCK!

One tiny little innocent FUCK!

And when I feel like I'm shit out of LUCK!

I find my stupified, coming back again 



Why, do you like playing around with

My, narrow scope of reality

I, can feel it all start slipping

I think I'm breaking down 



Why, do you like playing around with

My, narrow scope of reality

I, can feel it all start slipping away

See but I don't get it

Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit

Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it

I get stupified

It's all the same you say

Live with it 



But I don't get it

Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit

Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it

I get stupified 

I get stupified



All the people in the left wing ROCK!

And all the people in the right wing ROCK!

And all the people in the underground ROCK!

I find myself stupified, coming back again

All the people in the high rise ROCK!

And all the people in the projects ROCK!

And all la hente in the bario ROCK!

I find myself stupified, coming back again 



Why, do you like playing around with

My, narrow scope of reality

I, can feel it all start slipping

I think I'm breaking down

And don't deny me

No baby now, don't deny me

And darlin' don't be afraid...



But I don't get it

Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit

Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it

I get stupified 



Look in my face, stare in my soul

I begin to stupify. Ah!

Look in my face, stare in my soul

I begin to stupify. Ah!

Look in my face, stare in my soul

I begin to stupify. Ah!

Look in my face, stare in my soul

I begin to stupify. Ah!



Look in my face, stare in my soul

Look in my face, stare in my soul

Look in my face, stare in my soul

Look in my face, stare in my soul
