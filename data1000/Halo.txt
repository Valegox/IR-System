Remember those walls I built
Well baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in

But I never really had a doubt

Standing in the light of your halo

I've got my angel now



It's like I've been awakened

Every rule I had you breakin'

It's the risk that I'm takin'

I ain't never gonna shut you out



Everywhere I'm looking now

I'm surrounded by your embrace

Baby I can see your halo

You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more

It's written all over you face

Baby I can feel your halo

Pray it won't fade away



(I can feel your halo... halo...) halo

(I can see your) halo... (halo...) halo-o

(I can feel your) halo... (halo...) halo-o-o

(I can see your) halo... (halo...) halo... uhoo



Hit me like a ray of sun

Burning through my darkest nights

You're the only one that I want

Think I'm addicted to your light



I swore I'd never fall again

But this don't even feel like fallin'

Gravity can't forget

To pull me back to the ground again



It's like I've been awakened

Every rule I had you breakin'

It's the risk that I'm takin'

I ain't never gonna shut you out



Everywhere I'm looking now

I'm surrounded by your embrace

Baby I can see you halo

You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more

It's written all over you face

Baby I can feel your halo

Pray it won't fade away (#)



(I can feel your halo... halo...) halo

(I can see your) halo... (halo...) halo-o

(I can feel your) halo... (halo...) halo-o-o

(I can see your) halo... (halo...) halo

(I can see your) halo... (halo...) halo-o

Halo uhooo

halo uhooo uhooo uhoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo

Everywhere I'm looking now

I'm surrounded by your embrace

Baby I can see you halo

You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
