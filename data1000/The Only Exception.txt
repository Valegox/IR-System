When I was younger
I saw my daddy cry
And cursed at the wind
He broke his own heart
And i watched
As he tried to re-assemble it



And my momma swore 

that she would never let herself forget

And that was the day that I promised

I'd never sing of love

If it does not exist



But darlin',

You, are, the only exception

But, you, are, the only exception

But, you, are, the only exception

You, are, the only exception



Maybe i know, somewhere

Deep in my soul

That love never lasts

And we've got to find other ways

To make it alone

Or keep a straight face



And i've always lived like this

Keeping it comfortable, 

distance, and up until now

I'd sworn to myself that I'm content

With loneliness

Because none of it 

was ever worth the risk, but...



You, are, the only exception

You, are, the only exception

You, are, the only exception

You, are, the only exception



I've got a tight grip on reality

But I can't let go of what's in front of me here

I know you're leaving in the morning, when you wake up

Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream



Oh



You, are, the only exception

You, are, the only exception

You, are, the only exception

You, are, the only exception

You, are, the only exception

You, are, the only exception

You, are, the only exception

You, are, the only exception



And I'm on my way to believing.

Oh, And I'm on my way to believing.
