(with Morgan Phalen)
Before day break there were none
And as it broke there was one
The moon, the sun, it goes on'n'on

The winter better was warm

The summer children were born

And so the story goes on'n'on



Come women if your life beats

Those we buried with the house keys

Smoke and feather where the fields are

Green from here to eternity



Come woman on your own time

Far far far from the virgin vine

Rising out from the dead leaves

Come back to me



Oh sing your favorite song

Left to tears

Dreams it goes and then on



A vessel in the bloodline

The 13th zodiac sign

A stitch in time it goes on'n'on



Someday the grapes will be wine

Someday you will be mine

And so the story goes on'n'on



Come women if your life beats

Those we buried with the house keys

Smoke and feather where the fields are

Green from here to eternity



Come woman on your own time

Far far far from the virgin vine

Rising out from the dead leaves

Come back to me



Oh sing your favorite song

Left to tears

Dreams it goes and then on



Oh sing your favorite song

Left to tears

Dreams it goes and then on
