Undo these chains, my friend. I'll show you the rage I've hidden.
Perish the Sacrament. Swallow, but nothing's forgiven.
You and I can't decide which of us was taken for granted.
Make amends some of us are destined to be outlived.

Step inside/ See The Devil In I

Too many times, we've let it come to this

Step inside/ See The Devil In I

You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore



Under the words of men, something is tempting the father.

Where is your will, my friend? Insatiates never even bother.

You and I, wrong or right, traded a lie for the leverage.

In between the lens in light, you're not what you seem.



Step inside/ See The Devil In I

Too many times, we've let it come to this

Step inside/ See The Devil In I

You'll realize I'm not your Devil

I'm Not Your Devil Anymore



Your Station- Is Abandoned- Fool You cause I know what you've done

Sensation- Depravation- You should've burned when you turned on everyone



So Step inside/ See The Devil In I

Too many times

we've let it come to this

So Step inside

See The Devil In I

I know you'll find your answers in the end

Step inside/ See The Devil In I

You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore



So Step inside/ So step inside

See The Devil In I 

See The Devil In I
