Just as I thought it was going alright 
I find out I'm wrong, when I thought I was right 
s'always the same, it's just a shame, that's all 
I could say day, you'd say night 
tell it's black when I know that it's white 
s'always the same, it's just a shame, that's all 



I could leave but I won't go 

though my heart might tell me so 

I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes 

so why does it always seem to be 

me looking at you, you looking at me 

s'always the same, it's just a shame, that's all 



Turning me on, turning me off 

making me feel like I want too much 

living with you's just putting me through it all of the time 

running around, staying out all night 

taking it all instead of taking one bite 

living with you's just putting me through it all of the time 



I could leave but I won't go 

it'd be easier I know 

I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes 

but why does it always seem to be 

me looking at you, you looking at me 

s'always the same, just a shame, that's all 



Truth is I love you 

more than I wanted to 

there's no point in trying to pretend 

there's been no-one who 

makes me feel like you do 

say we'll be together til the end 



I could leave but I won't go 

it'd be easier I know 

I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes 

but why does it always seem to be 

me looking at you, you looking at me 

s'always the same, just a shame, that's all 



Just as I thought it was going alright 

I find out I'm wrong when I thought I was right 

s'always the same, just a shame, that's all 

I could say day, you'd say night 

tell me it's black when I know that it's white 

s'always the same, it's just a shame, that's all 



That's all
