Street's like a jungle
So call the police
Following the herd
Down to Greece - on holiday
Love in the nineties
Is paranoid

On sunny beaches

Take your chances - looking for



Girls who are boys

Who like boys to be girls

Who do boys like they're girls

Who do girls like they're boys

Always should be someone you really love



Avoiding all work

Cos there's none available

Like battery thinkers

Count your thoughts - on one two three four five fingers

Nothing is wasted

Only reproduced

You get nasty blisters

Du bist sehr schen

But we haven't been introduced.
