Don't cry snowman, not in front of me
Who will catch your tears if you can't catch me?
Darling
If you can't catch me
Darling
Don't cry snowman, don't leave me this way

A puddle of water can't hold me close

Baby

Can't hold me close

Baby



I want you to know that I'm never leaving

Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'till death we'll be freezing

Yeah you are my home, my home for all seasons

So come on let's go

Let's go below zero and hide from the sun

I love you forever where we'll have some fun

Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily

Please don't cry no tears now it's Christmas, baby



My snowman and me

My snowman and me

Baby



Don't cry snowman, don't you fear the sun

Who'll carry me without legs to run?

Honey

Without legs to run

Honey

Don't cry snowman, don't you shed a tear

Who'll hear my secrets if you don't have ears?

Baby

If you don't have ears

Baby



I want you to know that I'm never leaving

Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'till death we'll be freezing

Yeah, you are my home, my home for all seasons

So come on let's go

Let's go below zero and hide from the sun

I'll love you forever where we'll have some fun

Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily

Please don't cry no tears now it's Christmas baby



My snowman and me

My snowman and me

Baby
