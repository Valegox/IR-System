Just got my new weapon, the weapon of choice

Don't be shy by the tone of my voice

Just got my new weapon, the weapon of choice

And listen to the sound of my voice

I can chicken al loud, it's the weapon of choice

Yeah



Don't be shy by the tone of my voice

It's the new weapon, the weapon of choice

2x Chorus:

You can go with this,

Or you can go with that,

You can go with this,

Or you can go with that,

You can go with this,

Or you can go with that,

Or you can go with (us)-(only the 1st time)
