I will love you different
Just the way you are
And I will love you different
You pull up in a foreign
You that New York time, easy Sunday morning (Front seat)

When we touch I think we skip a beat (Beep, beep, beep)

It's a movie with you, got me at the edge (Let me see)



There’s a beauty on your lips

I drown with every kiss

I'm not used to this

There's nothing I won’t give

Don't like making promises

Just remember this



I will love you different

Just the way you arе

And I will love you different

That's what you been looking for

You'rе the fruit of my life

That patient kind

That tongue got me tongue-tied

And that's why

I will love you different

Just the way you are



No matter how different

You're beautiful

I can't make this up, no, baby

Ain't no need to beat your face in Fenty

Want you on the cover, under the covers

Ain’t no rubbers on this planet

I’ll treat you like a mother (Let's make babies)



There’s beauty on your lips

I drown with every kiss

I'm not used to this

There's nothing I won't give

Don’t like making promises

Just remember this



I will love you different

Just the way you are

And I will love you different

That's what you been looking for

You're the fruit of my life

That patient kind

That tongue got me tongue-tied

And that's why

I will love you different

Just the way you are



I and I

Need you in my life

Even when the fire burning I need you find the light

It's a different night

With you right by my side

You mix the color, color, color, color, see the future bright

This here mutual, it's not usual

When I'm around you I-I-I (Ooh)

Dem goose bumps, dem goose bumps

The truth hurt and you know

A real ting we feel this time (Ooh)

You gimme goose bumps yeah, yeah



I will love you different

Just the way you are

And I will love you different

That's what you been looking for
