Even in my heart I see
You're not bein' true to me
Deep within my soul I feel
Nothing's like it used to be
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem

But I wish I could so bad baby

Quit playin' games with my heart



Chorus



Quit playin' games with my heart

Before you tear us apart

I should've known from the start

Before you got in my heart



I live my life the way

To keep you comin' back to me

Everything I do is for you

So what is it that you can't see

Sometimes I wish I could

Turn back time, impossible as it may seem

But I wish I could so bad

You better quit playin' games with my heart



Chorus



Quit playin' games



Baby, baby the love that we had was so strong

Don't leave me hangin' here forever

Oh baby, baby this is not a lie, let's stop this tonight



Baby, quit playin' games



Sometimes I wish I could

Turn back time, impossible as it may seem

But I wish I could so bad, baby

Quit playin' games with my heart



Chorus
