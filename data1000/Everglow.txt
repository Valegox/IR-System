Well they say people come
Say people go
This particular diamond 
Was extra special
And though you might be gone
And the world may not know

Still I see you celestial



Like a lion you ran

A goddess you rolled

Like an eagle you circled

In perfect purple

So how come things move on?

How come cars don't slow?

When it feels like the end of my world?

When I should but I can't let you go



But when I'm cold,

Cold

And I'm cold

Cold

There's a light that you give me

When I'm in shadow

There's a feeling you give me, an everglow



Like brothers in blood

Sisters who ride

Yeah we swore on that night we'd 

Be friends till we died

But the changing of winds

And the way waters flow

Life is short as the falling of snow

And now I'm gonna miss you, I know



But when I'm cold

Cold

In water rolled

Salt

And I know that you're with me

Ant the way you will show

And you're with me wherever I go

But you give me this feeling, this everglow



Yeah what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold

Yeah I live for this feeling, this everglow



So if you love someone

You should let them know

Oh, the light that you left me will everglow
