Yeah, yeah, mmm
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plotting on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT you thot

Hundred thousand dollars on the table top

Half price my whips same price my watch

Got no jumper but I ball a lot

Bitch I'm young stoney, I do what I want

Candy paint with the white on top

Lambo doors are the oo-op drop (drop)

If you busy plotting on what I got

Kick in your door, that's SWAT you thot (pop)

Hundred thousand dollars on the table top

Half price my whips same price my watch

Got no jumper, but I ball a lot (swish)

Bitch I'm young stoney, I do what I want



Didn't know that was your girl when she gave me top

Kicked her out the Rolls said, "Thanks a lot"

God damn I love paper like I'm Michael Scott

I can do things that your man cannot

Slide boy comin' down, damn, I'm hot (hot)

Everybody say that I gotta be stopped

Even though my final form ain't unlocked

I'm so far ahead of you motherfuckers

How you comprehend what you ain't understanding?

Count a hundred bands and I watch it vanish

Diamonds going crazy like they on the dance floor

Got a lot of ass, nothing I can't handle



Flavor that's whatever, you should try a sample

Baby I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza

Everybody trying to tell me what I stand for

But you don't fucking know me homie you don't want war



Candy paint with the white on top

Lambo doors are the oo-op drop

If you busy plotting on what I got

Kick in your door, that's SWAT you thot

Hundred thousand dollars on the table top

Half price my whips same price my watch

Got no jumper but I ball a lot

Bitch I'm young stoney, I do what I want

Candy paint with the white on top

Lambo doors are the oo-op drop

If you busy plotting on what I got

Kick in your door, that's SWAT you thot

Hundred thousand dollars on the table top

Half price my whips same price my watch

Got no jumper but I ball a lot

Bitch I'm young stoney, I do what I want



I've been rolling twenty ash, hit the road

Hit the switch up the suicide doors

We already know you vanished though

Hit my momma when I ride in that, oh

All these motherfuckers so false with me

If your money funny, don't talk to me (nah)

I know there is shit that you could offer me

Take a second if you think about crossing me



It lasts forever, you should try a sample (goddamn)

Baby I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza

Everybody trying to tell me what I stand for

But you don't fucking know me homie you don't want war



Candy paint with the white on top

Lambo doors are the oo-op drop

If you busy plotting on what I got

Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot

Hundred thousand dollars on the table top

Half price my whips same price my watch

Got no jumper but I ball a lot

Bitch I'm young stoney, I do what I want

Candy paint with the white on top

Lambo doors are the oo-op drop

If you busy plotting on what I got

Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot

Hundred thousand dollars on the table top

Half price my whips same price my watch

Got no jumper but I ball a lot

Bitch I'm young stoney, I do what I want
