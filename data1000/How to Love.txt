You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever

Now you in the corner tryna put it together

How to love

How to love



For a second you were here

Why you over there?

It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body

Like you never had a love

Never had a love



When you was just a young'un you're looks but so precious

But now your grown up

So fly it's like a blessing but you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds

Without you being insecure

You never credit yourself so when you got older

It's seems like you came back 10 times over

Now you're sitting here in this damn corner

Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder



See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart

Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out

How to love

How to love



See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever

Now you in the corner tryna put it together

How to love

How to love



For a second you were here

Why you over there?

It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body

Like you never had a love

Had a love



You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions

The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions

But it wasn't your fault

Wasn't in your intentions

You the one here talking to me

You don't wanna listen

But I admire your poppin bottles and dippin'

Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping

Baby, so don't be mad

Nobody else trippin

You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook



See You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart

Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out

How to love

How to love



See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever

Now you in the corner tryna put it together

How to love

How to love



Oooh,

See I just want you to know

That you deserve the best

You're beautiful

You're beautiful

Yeah



And I want you to know, you're far from the usual

Far from the usual



You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart

Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out

How to love

How to love



See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever

Now you in the corner tryna put it together

How to love

How to love



See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart

Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out

How to love

How to love



See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever

Now you in the corner tryna put it together

How to love

How to love
