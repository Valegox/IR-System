Oh her eyes her eyes 
Make the stars look like they're not shining. 
Her hair , her hair 
falls perfectly without her trying 
She's so beautiful and I tell her every day 



I know, I know 

When I compliment her she wont believe me 

And it's so, it's so 

Sad to think she don't see what I see 



But every time she asks me 'Do I look okay?' I say 



When I see your face 

There's not a thing that I would change 

Cause you're amazing 

Just the way you are 



And when you smile 

The whole world stops and stares for a while 

'Cause girl you're amazing 

Just the way you are 



Her lips, her lips 

I could kiss them all day if she'd let me 



Her laugh, Her laugh 

She hates but I think it's so sexy 



She's so beautiful and i tell her every day 



Oh you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change 

If perfect is what you're searching for 

Then just stay the same 



So don't even bother asking if you look okay 

You know I say 



When I see your face 

There's not a thing that I would change 

Cause you're amazing 

Just the way you are 



And when you smile 

The whole world stops and stares for a while 

'Cause girl you're amazing 

just the way you are 



The way you are 

The way you are 

Girl you're amazing 

Just the way you are 



When I see your face 

There's not a thing that I would change 

'Cause you're amazing 

Just the way you are 



And when you smile 

The whole world stops and stares for a while 

'Cause girl you're amazing 

Just the way you are 



Yeaaaah
