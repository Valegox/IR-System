Me and my n*ggas tryna get it, ya bish
Hit this house then tell me is you with it, ya bish
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Back when Compton rappers wasn't cool

I f*cked Sherene then went to tell my bros

Then Usher Raymond "Let it Burn" came on

Hot sauce all in my Top Ramen, ya bish

Parked the car, then we started rhyming, ya bish

The only thing we had to free - our mind

Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs

You looking like an easy come up, ya bish

A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish

And that's a lifestyle that we never knew

Go at a reverend for the revenue



It go Halle Berry or Hallelujah

Pick your poison, tell me what you do

Everybody gon' respect the shooter

But the one in front of the gun lives forever

And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way

Through canals and alleyways, just to say

Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel

A dollar might just f*ck your main b*tch, that's just how I feel

A dollar might, say f*ck them n*ggas that you came with, that's just how I feel

A dollar might just make that lane switch, that's just how I feel

A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich, that's just how I feel



Dreams of living life like rappers do

Bump that new E-40 at the school

You know big ballin' with my homies

Earl Stevens had us thinking rational

Back to reality, we poor, ya bish

Another casualty of war, ya bish

Two bullets in my uncle Tony head

He said one day I'd be on tour, ya bish

That Louie's Burger never be the same

A Louis belt will never ease that pain

But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin'

Pull off at Church's with Pirelli's skirtin'

Gang signs out the window, ya bish

Hoping all of em offend you, ya bish

They say your hood is a pot of gold

And we gone crash it when nobody's home



It go Halle Berry or Hallelujah

Pick your poison, tell me what you do

Everybody gon' respect the shooter

But the one in front of the gun lives forever

And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way

Through canals and alleyways, just to say

Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel

A dollar might just f*ck your main b*tch, that's just how I feel

A dollar might, say f*ck them n*ggas that you came with, that's just how I feel

A dollar might just make that lane switch, that's just how I feel

A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich, that's just how I feel



Be the last one out to get this dough? No way

Love one of you bucket headed hoes? No way

Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way

Hit the brakes, when they on patrol? No way



Be the last one out to get this dough? No way

Love one of you bucket headed hoes? No way

Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way

Hit the brakes, when they on patrol? No way



Imagine Rock up in them projects

Where them n*ggas pick your pockets

Santa Claus don't miss them stockings

Liquor spilling, pistols popping

Baking soda, YOLA whipping

Ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving

My homeboy just domed a n*gga

I just hope the Lord forgive him

Pots with cocaine residue

Everyday I'm hustling

What else is a thug to do?

When you eat cheese from the government

Gotta provide for my daughter an' 'em

Get the f*ck up out my way, b*tch

Got that drum and I got them bass

Just like a parade, b*tch

Drop that work up in the bushes

Hope them boys don't see my stash

If they do tell the truth

This the last time you might see my ass

From the gardens where the grass ain't cut

Them serpents lurking blood

B*tches selling pussy, n*ggas selling drugs

But it's all good

Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is

Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a Footlocker is

In the streets with a heater under my dungarees

Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree



It go Halle Berry or Hallelujah

Pick your poison, tell me what you do

Everybody gon' respect the shooter

But the one in front of the gun lives forever

And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way

Through canals and alleyways, just to say

Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
