Sleeping is giving in,
no matter what the time is.
Sleeping is giving in,
so lift those heavy eyelids.


People say that you'll die

faster than without water.

But we know it's just a lie,

scare your son, scare your daughter.





People say that your dreams

are the only things that save ya.

Come on baby in our dreams,

we can live our misbehavior.





Every time you close your eyes

Lies, Lies!





People try and hide the night

underneath the covers.

People try and hide the light

underneath the covers.





Come on hide your lovers

underneath the covers,

come on hide your lovers

underneath the covers.





Hidin' from your brothers

underneath the covers,

come on hide your lovers

underneath the covers.





People say that you'll die

faster than without water,

but we know it's just a lie,

scare your son, scare your daughter,





Scare your son, scare your daughter.





Now here's the sun, it's alright! (Lies!)

Now here's the moon, it's alright! (Lies!)

Now here's the sun, it's alright! (Lies!)

Now here's the moon it's alright (Lies!)
