I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy

Yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy)





I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek

Oh well, guess beggers can't be choosey

Wanted to receive attention for my music

Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me

Been wanting my cake, And eat it too

And wanting it both ways

Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated

When I blew seep and it was confusing

Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf

Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam

Hit the lottery (oh wee)

With what I gave up to get was bittersweet

It was like winning a huge meet

Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink

I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep

Going cuckoo and cookey as Kool Keith

But I'm actually weirder than you think

Cause I'm...





I'm friends with the monster

That's under my bed

Get along with the voices inside of my head

You're trying to save me

Stop holding your breath

And you think I'm crazy

Yeah, you think I'm crazy



Well, that's nothing

oh oh oh oh

Well, that's nothing

oh oh oh oh





Now I ain't much of a poet

But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment

And don't squander it

Cause you never know when it could all be over

Tomorrow so I keep conjuring

Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from

(Yeah, ponder it, do you want this? there's no wonder you're losing your mind the way you're wandering?)

I think you've been wandering off down yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen

Cause I needed an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster

And save me from myself and all this conflict

Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it

My OCD is conking me in the head

Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking

I'm just relaying what the voice in my head saying

Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the...





I'm friends with the monster

That's under my bed

Get along with the voices inside of my head

You're trying to save me

Stop holding your breath

And you think I'm crazy

Yeah, you think I'm crazy



Well, that's nothing

oh oh oh oh

Well, that's nothing

oh oh oh oh





Call me crazy, but I had this vision

One day that, I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian

But, until then,

drums get killed and I'm Coming straight at

Emcees, blood get spilled and I

Take it back to the days that, I get on a Dre track

Give every kid who got played at

Pumped the feeling

and shit to say back

To the kids who played 'em

I ain't here to save the fucking children

But if one kid out of a hundred million

Who are going through a struggle feels and it relates that's great

It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back

In the draft, turn nothing into something still, can make that

Straw in the gold chump I will spend

Rumpelstiltskin in a hay stack

Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts

I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that

It's nothing, I'm still friends with the...





I'm friends with the monster

That's under my bed

Get along with the voices inside of my head

You're trying to save me

Stop holding your breath

And you think I'm crazy

Yeah, you think I'm crazy



I'm friends with the monster

That's under my bed

(Get along with)

Get along with the voices inside of my head

(You're tryna)

You're trying to save me

Stop holding your breath

And you think I'm crazy

Yeah, you think I'm crazy



Well, that's nothing
