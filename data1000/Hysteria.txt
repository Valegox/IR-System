It's bugging me
Grating me
And twisting me around
Yeah I'm endlessly
Caving in
And turning inside out



'Cause I want it now

I want it now

Give me your heart and your soul

And I'm breaking out

I'm breaking out

Last chance to lose control



It's holding me, morphing me

And forcing me to strive

To be endlessly cold within

And dreaming I'm alive



'Cause I want it now

I want it now

Give me your heart and your soul

And I'm not breaking down

I'm breaking out

Last chance to lose control



And I want you now

I want you now

I'll feel my heart implode

I'm breaking out

Escaping now

Feeling my faith erode
