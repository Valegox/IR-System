Ooh, oohWhen the visions around youBring tears to your eyesAnd all that surrounds youAre secrets and liesI'll be your strengthI'll give you hopeKeeping your faith when it's goneThe one you should callWhen standing here all aloneAnd I will take you in my armsAnd hold you right where you belongUntil the day my life is throughThis I promise youThis I promise youI've loved you foreverIn lifetimes beforeAnd I promise you neverWill you hurt anymoreI give you my wordI give you my heartThis is a battle we've wonAnd with this vowForever has now begunJust close your eyes each loving dayAnd know this feeling won't go awayTill the day my life is throughThis I promise youThis I promise youOver and over I thoughtWhen I hear you callWithout you in my life babyI just wouldn't be living at allAnd I will take you in my armsAnd hold you right where you belongUntil the day my life is throughThis I promise youThis I promise youJust close your eyes each loving dayAnd know this feeling won't go awayTill the day my life is throughThis I promise youThis I promise youEvery word I say is trueThis I promise youOoh I promise you
