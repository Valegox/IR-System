Not everyone can be like me and Michael
The only problem is forgetting which side you're on
So you think the burning light will reappear on summer nights
Like all the rest, but they can't find out
In every scene, it's me and Michael

Imaginary bombs raining down from the clouds

So it seems the losing side will never let the feelings die

When all the best and brightest have gone



Me and Michael

Solid as they come

Me and Michael

It's not a question now

It's me and Michael

Solid as they come

Me and Michael

It's not a question now

Me and Michael



Not every soul will sink like the setting sun

Too happy with ourselves to notice when the change will come

So you think the losing side would never break the fine lines

When sanctity wasn't a thing of doubt



Me and Michael

Solid as they come

Me and Michael

It's not a question now

It's me and Michael

Solid as they come

Me and Michael

It's not a question now

Me and Michael
