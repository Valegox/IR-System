Live another day 
Climb a litle higher
Find another reason to stay
Ashes in your hands
Mercy in your eyes
If you're searching for a silent sky...

You won't find it here 

Look another way

You won't find it here 

So die another day

The coldness of this words

The message in his silence,

"Face the candle to to the wind..."

This distance in my voice 

Isn't leaving you a choice

So if you're looking for a time to run away...

You won't find it here

Look another way

You won't find it here

So try another day 

They took picture of our dreams

Ran to hide behind the stairs

And said maybe when it's right

for you, they'll fall

Butif they don't come down

Resist to need to pull them in

And throw them away

Better to save the mystery

Than surrender to the secret

You won't find it here

Look another way

You won't find it here

So try another day
