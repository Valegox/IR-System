You guys ready...
Alone... listless... breakfast table in an otherwise empty room
Young girl... violins... center of her own attention
The, mother reads aloud, child, tries to understand it
Tries to make her proud



The shades go down, it's in her head

Painted room... can't deny there's something wrong...



Don't call me daughter, not fit to

The picture kept will remind me

Don't call me daughter, not fit to

The picture kept will remind me

Don't call me...



She holds the hand that holds her down

She will...rise above...ooh...oh...



Don't call me daughter, not fit to

The picture kept will remind me (2x)

Don't call me daughter, not fit to be

The picture kept will remind me

Don't call me...



The shades go down (2x)

The shades go, go, go...
