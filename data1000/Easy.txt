I know it sounds funny but I just can't stand the pain
Girl I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me girl you know I've done all I can
You see I begged, stole, and I borrowed
That's why I'm easy
Easy like Sunday morning

That's why I'm easy

Easy like Sunday morning

I wanna' be high

So high

I wanna' be free to know the things I do are right

I wanna' be free

Just me

Oh baby...

That's why I'm easy

I'm easy like Sunday morning

That's why I'm easy

I'm easy like Sunday morning
