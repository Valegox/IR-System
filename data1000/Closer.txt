Stranded in this spooky town
Stoplights are swaying and the phone lines are down
This floor is crackling cold
She took my heart, I think she took my soul
With the moon I run
Far from the carnage of the fiery sun



Driven by the strangled vein

Showing no mercy I do it again

Open up your eye

You keep on crying, baby

I'll bleed you dry

The skies are blinking at me

I see a storm bubbling up from the sea



And it's coming closer

And it's coming closer



You, shimmy shook my bone

Leaving me stranded all in love on my own

What do you think of me

Where am I now? Baby where do I sleep

Feel so good but I'm old,

2000 years of chasing taking its toll



And it's coming closer
