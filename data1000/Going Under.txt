Now I will tell you what I've done for you
50 thousand tears I've cried
Screaming deceiving and bleeding for you
and you still won't hear me (going under)
Don't want your hand this time I'll save myself
Maybe I'll wake up for once (wake up for once)

Not tormented daily defeated by you

Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom

I'm dying again



I'm going under (going under)

Drowning in you (drowning in you)

I'm falling forever (falling forever)

I've got to break through, I'm

Going under



Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies

so I don't know what's real and what's not

always confusing the thoughts in my head

so I can't trust myself anymore

I'm dying again



I'm going under (going under)

Drowning in you (drowning in you)

I'm falling forever (falling forever)

I've got to break through, I'm



So go on and scream

Scream at me, I'm so far away

I won't be broken again

I've got to breathe I can't keep going under.



I'm dying again



I'm going under (going under)

Drowning in you (drowning in you)

I'm falling forever (falling forever)

I've got to break through, I'm



Going under (going under)

Going under (drowning in you)

I'm going under
