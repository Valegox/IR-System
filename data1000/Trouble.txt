Oh no, I see
a spiderweb is tangled up with me
and I lost my head
and thought of all the stupid things I'd said
oh no, what's this?

a spiderweb and I'm caught in the middle

so I turned to run

and thought of all the stupid things I'd done



and I never meant to cause you trouble

and I never never meant to do your wrong

ah, well if I ever caused you trouble

oh no I never meant to do you harm 



oh no, I see

a spiderweb and it's me in the middle

so I twist and turn

but here am I in my little bubble



singing and I never meant to cause you trouble

and I never meant to do you wrong

ah, well if I ever caused you trouble

oh no I never meant to do you harm



they spun a web for me

they spun a web for me

they spun a web for me
