Wait a minute
Let me finish 
I know you don't care
But, can you listen?
I came commited, guess I overdid it
Wore my heart out on a chain

Around my neck but now it's missing, hmm



So I think I better go

I never really know how to please you

You're looking at me like I'm see through

I guess I'm gonna go

I just never know how you feel

Do you even feel anything?



You said don't treat me badly

But you said it so sadly

So I did the best I could

Not thinking you would have left me gladly



I know you're not sorry

Why should you be

'Cause who am I to be in love

When your love never is for me

Me



So I think I better go

I never really know how to please you

You're looking at me like I'm see through

I guess I'm gonna go

I just never know how you feel

Do you even feel anything?
