Icky thump
Who'da thunk?
Sittin drunk on a wagon to Mexico?
Ahh well
What a chump

Well my head got a bump

When I hit it on the radio



Redhead senorita

Looking dead

Came and said

"Need a bed?"

En Espanol



I said 

"Gimme a drink a water,

I'm gonna 'sing around the collar'

And I don't need a microphone."



Icky Thump

With a lump in my throat

Grabbed my coat

And I was freaking

I was ready to go!



And I swear

Besides the hair

She had: one white eye,

One black (nk) stare

Lookin' up

Lyin' there.



On the stand

Near her hand

Was a candy cane

Black rum, sugar cane

Dry ice (and) something strange



La la la la la la la

La la la la la la la



White Americans, what?

Nothing better to do?

Why don't you kick yourself out

You're an immigrant too?



Who's using who?

What should we do?

Well, you can't be a pimp

And a prostitue too.



Icky thump

Handcuffed to a bunk

Robbed blind

Looked around

And there was nobody else



Left alone

I hit myself with a stone

Went home and learned how

To clean up after myself.
