all along the western front
people line up to receive
she got the current in her hand
just shock you like you won't believe
sun in the amazon
with the voltage running through her skin

standing there with nothing on

she gonna teach me how to swim



i said ooh girl

shock me like an electric feel

baby girl

turn me on with your electric feel

i said ooh girl

shock me like an electric feel

baby girl

turn me on with your electric feel



all along the eastern shore

put your circuits in the sea

this is what the world is for

making electricity

you can feel it in your mind

oh you can do it all the time

plug it in, change the world

you are my electric girl



i said ooh girl

shock me like an electric feel

baby girl

turn me on with your electric feel

i said ooh girl

shock me like an electric feel

baby girl

turn me on with your electric feel



do what you feel now

electric feel now

do what you feel now

electric feel now

do what you feel now

electric feel now

do what you feel now

electric feel now

do what you feel now

electric feel now
