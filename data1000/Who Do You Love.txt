Found cigarettes in your Fendi coat
Even though you don't even smoke
Always changin' your access codes
Yeah, I can tell you no one knew

Yeah, you've been actin' so conspicuous

You flip it on me, say I think too much

You're movin' different when we makin' love

Baby, tell me, tell me



Who do you love, do you love now?

I wanna know the truth (Whoa)

Who do you love, do you love now?

I know it's someone new

You ain't gotta make it easy, where you been sleepin'?

This shit is keepin' me up at night, just admit it

Who do you love, do you love now?

I wanna know, I wanna know who

Or stutterin' when you reply

You flip it on me, say I think too much

We're movin' different while we're makin' love
