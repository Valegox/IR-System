Little black submarines
operator please
put me back on the line
told my girl i'd be back
operator please
this is wrecking my mind



Oh, can it be

the voices calling me

they get lost and out of time

I should've seen it glow

but everybody knows

that a broken heart is blind

that a broken heart is blind



Pick you up, let you down

when I wanna go

to a place I can hide

you know me, I had plans

but they just disappeared

to the back of my mind



Oh, can it be



The voices calling me

they get lost and out of time

I should've seen it glow

but everybody knows

that a broken heart is blind

that a broken heart is blind



Treasure maps for a dream,

operator please

call me back when it's time

stolen friends and disease

operator please

pass me back to my mind



Oh, can it be

the voices calling me

they get lost and out of time

I should've seen it glow

but everybody knows

that a broken heart is blind

that a broken heart is blind

that a broken heart is blind
