Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
We couldn't turn around

'Til we were upside down

I'll be the bad guy now

But no, I ain't too proud

Why could it be that?

Even when I try

You don't believe it

We do this every time



Seasons change and our love went cold

Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go

Run away but we're running in circles

Run away, run away

I dare you to do something

I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame

Run away but we're running in circles

Run away, run away, run away, oh



I got a feeling it's time to let go

I said so,

I knew that this was doomed from the get-go

You thought that it was special, special

But it was just a sex doll, the sex doll

And I still hear the echoes, echoes

I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go



Seasons change and our love went cold

Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go

Run away but we're running in circles

Run away, run away

I dare you to do something

I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame

Run away but we're running in circles

Run away, run away, run away



Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through

It's only me, what you got to lose?

Make up your mind, tell me what are you gonna do

It's only me, let it go



Seasons change and our love went cold

Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go

Run away but we're running in circles

Run away, run away

I dare you to do something

I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame

Run away but we're running in circles

Run away, run away, run away
