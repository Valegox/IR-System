As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
We're under pressure, seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together, smile on your face even though your heart is frowning

But hey now, you know girl, we both know it's a cruel world

But I will take my chances



As long as you love me, we could be starving,

We could be homeless, we could be broke

As long as you love me i'll be your platinum, i'll be your silver, i'll be your gold

As long as you lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love me

As long as you lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love me



I'll be your soldier, fighting every second of the day for your dream girl

I'll be your Hova, you can be my Destiny's Child on a stinger

So don't stress, don't cry, oh we don't need no wings to fly

Just take my hand



As long as you love me we could be starving,

We could be homeless, we could be broke

As long as you love me i'll be your platinum, i'll be your silver, i'll be your gold

As long as you lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love me

As long as you lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love me



I don't make if this make sense

You're my hallelujah

Give me a time and place, i'll rendez-vous

I'll fly it to ya, i'll meet you there

Girl you know I got you

Us, trust, a couple things I can't spell without you

No we on top of the world

Cause that's just how we do

Used to tell me sky's the limit

Now the skies are point of view

Now we stepping out like woah

Cameras point at you, ask me what's best side

I'll stand back and point at you, you, you

The one that I argue with,

Feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with

But the grass ain't always greener on the other side

It's greener where you water it

So I know, we got issues baby, true true true

But I rather work on this with you

Than then go ahead and start with someone new



As you love me we could be starving

We could be homeless, we could be broke

As long as you love me i'll be your platinum, i'll be your silver, i'll be your gold

As long as you lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love me

As long as you lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love me



As long as you lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love me

As long as you lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love me

As long as you love me, you love me, lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love me
