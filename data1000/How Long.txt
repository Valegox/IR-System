Ooh, yeah
I'll admit, I was wrong
What else can I say, girl?
Can't you break my head and not my heart?
I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right but

I promise there were no feelings involved



She said "Boy, tell me honestly

Was it real or just for show?" (yeah)

She said "Save your apologies

Baby, I just gotta know"



How long has this been goin' on?

You've been creepin' 'round on me

While you're callin' me baby

How long has this been goin' on?

You've been actin' so shady (shady)

I've been feelin' it lately, baby



Ooo-oh, yeah

Ooo-oh, encore

Oooh-ooh-oh



I'll admit, it's my fault

But you gotta believe me

When I say it only happened once

I tried and I tried, but you'll never see that

You're the only one I wanna love, ooh, yeah

Was it real or just for show?" (real or just for show)
