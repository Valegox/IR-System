On the corner of main street
Just tryin' to keep it in line
You say you wanna move on and
You say I'm falling behind
Can you read my mind?

Can you read my mind?



I never really gave up on

Breakin' out of this two-star town

I got the green light

I got a little fight

I'm gonna turn this thing around



Can you read my mind?

Can you read my mind?



The good old days, the honest man;

The restless heart, the Promised Land

A subtle kiss that no one sees;

A broken wrist and a big trapeze



Oh well I don't mind, you don't mind

Cause I don't shine if you don't shine

Before you go, can you read my mind?



It?s funny how you just break down

Waitin' on some sign

I pull up to the front of your driveway

With magic soakin' my spine



Can you read my mind?

Can you read my mind?



The teenage queen, the loaded gun;

The drop dead dream, the Chosen One

A southern drawl, a world unseen;

A city wall and a trampoline



Oh well I don't mind, you don't mind

Cause I don't shine if you don't shine

Before you go

Tell me what you find when you read my mind



Slippin? in my faith until I fall

He never returned that call

Woman, open the door, don't let it stay

I wanna breathe that fire again



She said

Oh well I don't mind, you don't mind

Coz I don't shine if you don't shine



Put your back on me

Put your back on me

Put your back on me



The stars are blazing like rebel diamonds cut out of the sun

When you read my mind
