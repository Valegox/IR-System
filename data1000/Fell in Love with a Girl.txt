Fell in love with a girl
fell in love once and almost completely
she's in love with the world
but sometimes these feelings
can be so misleading
she turns and says are you alright?

I said I must be fine cause my heart's still beating

come and kiss me by the riverside,

bobby says it's fine he don't consider it cheating



Red hair with a curl

mellow roll for the flavor

and the eyes were peeping

can't keep away from the girl

these two sides of my brain

need to have a meeting

can't think of anything to do

my left brain knows that

all love is fleeting

she's just looking for something new

and I said it once before

but it bears repeating
