Come ride with me through the veils of history,
I'll show you a God falls asleep on the job,
How can we win when fools can be kings?
Don't waste your time or time will waste you
No-one's going to take me alive

The time has come to make things right

You and I must fight for our rights

You and I must fight to survive 



No-one's going to take me alive

The time has come to make things right

You and I must fight for our rights

You and I must fight to survive 



No-one's going to take me alive

The time has come to make things right

You and I must fight for our rights

You and I must fight to survive
