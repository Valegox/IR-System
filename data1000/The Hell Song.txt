Everybody's got their problems [problems].
Everbody says the same thing to you.
It's just a matter of how you solve them [solve them],
And knowing how to change the things you've been through.
I feel I've come to realize 
How fast life can be compromised.

Step back to see what's going on.

I can't believe this happened to you...

This happened to you...



It's just a problem now I'm faced with. Am I,

Not the only one who hates to stand by?

Complications ended first in this line, 

With all these pictures running through my mind.

Knowing endless

Consequences

I feel so useless in this.

Get back, 

Step back, 

And as for me, I can't believe,



Part of me,

Won't agree,

'Cause I don't know if it's for sure.

Suddenly,

Suddenly, 

I don't feel so insecure.



Part of me,

Won't agree,

'Cause I don't know if it's for sure.

Suddenly,

Suddenly,

I don't feel so insecure,

Anymore...



Everybody's got their problems [problems].

Everybody says the same thing to you.

It's just a matter of how you solve them [solve them]

But what else are we s'posed to do...

Why do things that matter the most,

Never end up being what we chose?

Now that I find no way so bad

I don't think I knew what I had.
