How can I just let you walk away?
Just let you leave without a trace?
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ohoo
You're the only one who really knew me at all
How can you just walk away from me?
When all I can do is watch you leave?

Cuz we shared the laughter and the pain

and even shared the tears

You're the only one who really knew me at all



Chorus:

So take a look at me now

Cause there's just an empty space

And there's nothin left here to remind me

Just the memory of your face

Take a look at me now

Cuz there's just an empty space

And you comin back to me is against the odds

and that's what I've gotta face.



I wish I could just make you turn around

Turn around and see me cry

There's so much I need to say to you,

So many reasons why

You're the only one who really knew me at all



Chorus

So take a look at me now

cuz there's just an empty space

And there's nothin left here to remind me

just the memory of your face

Take a look at me now

Cus there's just an empty space

But to wait for you, is all I can do

and that's what I gotta face



Take a good look at me now

I'll still be standing there

And you comming back to me is against all odds

It's the chance i gotta take



End

Just take a look at me now
