(Stevie Nicks)
I took my love and I took it down
Climbed a mountain and turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
'til the landslide brought me down



Oh, mirror in the sky - What is love?

Can the child within my heart rise above?

Can I sail through the changin'...ocean tides

Can I handle the seasons of my life?



Well I've been afraid of changin'

because I've built my life around you

But time makes you bolder, 

even children get older

And I'm getting older too.... (x2)



I'm getting older too



take my love... take it down

Climb a mountain and turn around

and if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills...

well the landslide will bring it down

and if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills...

well the landslide will bring it down

The landslide will bring it down
