Highway run
Into the midnight sun
Wheels go round and round
You're on my mind
Restless hearts
Sleep alone tonight

Sending all my love

Along the wire



They say that the road

Ain't no place to start a family

Right down the line

It's been you and me

And lovin' a music man

Ain't always what it's supposed to be

Oh, girl, you stand by me

I'm forever yours

Faithfully



Circus life

Under the big top world

We all need the clowns

To make us smile

Through space and time

Always another show

Wondering where I am

Lost without you



And being apart

Ain't easy on this love affair

Two strangers learn to fall in love again

I get the joy of rediscovering you

Oh, girl, you stand by me

I'm forever yours

Faithfully



Whooa, oh-oh-ooh

Whooa, oh-oh-ooh, oh

Whooa, oh-oh-oh, oh-whoooooa-oh

Faithfully

I'm still yours



I'm forever yours

Ever yours

Faithfully
